Had a couple of drinks on a Thursday night at the bar, which is really</value><value> wonderful. It has an amazing view, is well set out and just has a good feel to it. My only gripe is it shut at 1030pm which I thought was a bit early. Would love to have eaten in the resaurant but didn't have time. It looked pretty amazing.

<item><hotel_name><value>Hotel Challis</value></hotel_name><title><value>Comfortable stay just out of the CBD</value></title><content><value>We used the hotel's main Web site to book and there is a free promo code on it giving you some benefits which is good. We checked in 4 hours early and our room was ready but maybe just because of time of year? Hotel seems nice enough, our room was on the rear of the building</value><value> over looking a school field, noisy during the day but quiet at night. The gardeners decided however to cut the grass at 7.30 am and school activities start quite early so don't expect much of a lay in. Room is very compact and could use some additional shelving or storage especially in the toilet room.The king bed was massive and very comfortable though. Shower is nice and big, almost half the size of the toilet room easily big enough for two. Staff seem friendly and helpful even new staff being trained as we checked in. If you don't mind a short walk from the city and up hill this is a nice little place but not convinced for disabled/ special needs guests.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

The outside of the building could be called "quaint" and retained it's character well. The wifi was always available and free to use in the bedrooms, downstairs in the lounge and terrace. There are restaurants and cafes nearby. The train station is an 8 min walk away but that does not take you directly into the centre of Sydney.

<item><hotel_name><value>West Hotel Sydney, Curio Collection by Hilton</value></hotel_name><title><value>Nice &amp; comfortable hotel</value></title><content><value>I stayed here a couple of times in one week and enjoyed this hotel. I normally stay at the Hilton Sydney, and am pretty loyal to Hilton hotels over many years, so thought I would give the West Hotel Curio a go.  The design/style of the hotel is really excellent. All areas of the</value><value> hotel are really ascetically pleasing, and the rooms while small, are really comfortable and stylish. So I enjoyed my stays here and will definitely be back.   As it is a Hilton family hotel, the staff are well trained, and service is good. It is a very pleasant and comfortable hotel to stay in.   I haven't previously stayed in this part of town, and found it interesting, The Rocks and Quay are within walking distance, and immediately around the hotel are a lot of shops, bars, restaurants &amp; mini super markets, so it is convenient for travellers. From Wynyard train station is quite manageable with a suitcase with wheels - as long as you don't have a lot of luggage.  I wouldn't really expect to get a view from rooms at this hotel --- except perhaps for some rooms in the suite spot gap on the Barangaroo side. The hotel is only 8 floors and all the buildings nearby are much taller.... So if I was staying again I would just book the Atrium or Banksia -- not the other room types.  While I really like this property, and will be back because I enjoyed the hotel and like a change, I still think the Hilton Sydney probably offers more amenity at a similar price, and as that hotel starts on level 20 all the rooms will have better views. For Gold or Diamond members the Hilton Sydney has an executive lounge, and you would get a minimum of a Deluxe room which has a bath tub also. Suites at Hilton Sydney are also better value as they are normally on a corner, larger, and include executive lounge access for a similar price to the West Hotel Curio suites.  So I will probably still chose Hilton Sydney as my go to hotel, but will be back to the Curio also as it is a very enjoyable and a refreshing change.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>West Hotel Sydney, Curio Collection by Hilton</value></hotel_name><title><value>Great Location and Service</value></title><content><value>I am delinquent in providing this review.  I stayed the West Hotel back in May of 2019.  First and foremost, the hotel is in an excellent location, within walking distance of Darling Harbour with its restaurants, nightlife, Aquarium, shopping, etc.  Near bus lines as well.  Easy</value><value> to walk to Darling to catch ferries around Sydney Harbour.    The staff were wonderful, very attentive and courteous.  The Full Breakfast was complimentary because of my Diamond Status with Hilton.  Even the standard breakfast is plentiful and filling.  We stayed 7 days and did the continental offering three of the days.  The delivered complimentary macrons to our room on the first night and nightly slipper service.  Nice touch!  The room was nice, good amount of power ports including USB charging next to your bed.  Bring power adapter for AUS if you are not going to use the USB ports.  Very little cabinet space, and only a small hanger section, so do prepare to live out of a suitcase.  Not the end of the world.    I will stay here again if I am ever lucky enough to return to Sydney.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

The hotel was very new, chic, warm, clean, quiet and comfortable!  The staff is very kind and friendly—great customer service throughout.  The breakfast was included in</value><value> my rate.  They do this very well as the hot food is ordered off a menu so no soggy food past its prime.  The selection is excellent and the cold stuff is on a buffet and you get a menu to order what you want if you care for hot food.  The hotel is an easy walk to King St wharf so lots to do. Very close to The Barangaroo ferry wharf and the Wynyard train station (900 yards to the Kent Street entrance). I walked with my bags to take the train to the International terminal. Quick, hassle free and inexpensive way to the airport.  There was a small fridge in the room and the staff did replenish my free 2 waters which was nice. I also liked the lotion and shower gel in the bathroom AND the robe and house shoes.  I can be picky but I have nothing that I did not like!

<item><hotel_name><value>Rydges World Square Sydney Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Numb by numbers</value></title><content><value>Booked an executive king room which, the website says, are located on the high floors and was allocated a balcony room on 12. Unknown to me at the time 12 is actually the first residential floor in the hotel and the tiny balcony no bonus. Why? Because sitting out on the single</value><value> chair on what is ostensibly a lobby roof courtyard was impossible due the smell of fat frying which, incidentally, permeated the 12th floor between my room and the lifts for the entire two nights. It seemed to me it was wafting in from the fans above the hotel kitchens fixed at 12 floor level. On arrival at my door on evening one found an empty wine bottle in a wine cooler directly outside and, bizarrely, after moving it down the corridor found it outside my door again the next evening!! On top of all that, my room on day 2 wasn’t serviced until 3pm when I had scheduled work in the room during the afternoon, this despite my being woken by cleaning equipment banging against my door repeatedly when the shift began early that morning. All in all a downer for mid to late $500s and as a loyalty member. Pluses? Yes, there were some. Great location, comfy bed and pillows, bathroom spotless. Would I stay again? Maybe. But I’ve learned my lesson: 12 is actually 1 and I’ll be looking for something around 19 or 20 which is really 7 or 8. Tip: if you book high floor, make sure it is, and see which way the wind is blowing if you are down on 12.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Shangri-La Hotel Sydney</value></hotel_name><title><value>Cafe Mix Shangrila -What a rococo of scammers!</value></title><content><value>The Cafe Mix Shangrila Seafood Buffet Dinner I purchased this Groupon voucher for two people. It was booked on 2 August 2019 at 0800 pm which I cancelled on the 1st of August 2019 due to having a flu with deep, contagious coughing. I dont feel as well and I have the sense of</value><value> good ness not to spread the disease to the clients and to hotel staff who will be in contact airborne with the virus. My Groupon apps messaged it was cancelled. However, it never allowed me to rebook through the reservation/booking site supplied for this purposes. I sent messages to Groupon to assist me in rebooking but I never received reply including Shangrila Hotel. I phoned last Monday to Groupon and the customer service (name withehld) said that, Shangrila marked my voucher redeemed. That is a huge scam and I call it high way robbery in disguise. Groupon also mentioned that they are waiting a reply from Shangrila as they put in my complaint until now they still have not received a reply. I messaged Shangrila myself and never received reply either. WE are talking about $100 voucher. NOt much compared to money I invested staying in their executive floors in Sydney and overseas.   Shangrila call themselves 5 stars but they don't have good customer service. Until now I am waiting for my rebooking of my voucher and if not a refund of my money. I am already suffering from major depression with eating and sleeping problems. Thought having a seafood buffet will help but never expected to have flu before it happened.   Shangrila is being disgraceful and no shame by claiming a voucher redeemed even if not so. I perceived from their action that they wanted me to appear to the restaurant and share my flu virus to their clients and staff and cough on the seafood buffet just to claim my $100 worth of voucher. This is evident by marking my voucher as claimed while the fact is not true. Dishonesty!!!!  I suggest not to eat in the hotel or buffets. They don't care about health of patronage. Maybe because after all its buffet. Welcome including sharing your virus and microbes.   I marked them cleanliness terrible because obviously they dont care if the patronage is carrying diseases or airborne virus despite that they had been messaged about it.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

We had seen some pictures online and were very excited for our stay. Upon arrival, the receptionist who was absolutely lovely and welcoming upgraded our room to a higher floor as those rooms had recently been</value><value> refurbished!   Our room (Deluxe King)- spotless and beautiful with an amazing view of the harbour. We left the room for a couple of hours for dinner and when we came back, we had noticed that housekeeping had been in to touch up the little things! New towels had been brought in, our beds were touched up and they left a bottle of water with a glass on each bedside table as well as a bucket of ice! We have never experienced this in another hotel room therefore we thought it was extremely kind and thoughtful.   We went down to the pool areas to use the hot tub and had a fantastic time. The staff were kind and friendly and everything was so clean!   We couldn’t get the tv to work therefore called down to reception and maintenance came up straight away and got it to work for us. He was very professional and sincerely apologized for the “inconvenience” although it of course was not his fault!   We ordered room service for breakfast and everything was brought up to the room within 30 minutes, it was delicious and the way it was all presented was very lovely.   What I loved the most about this hotel is how they use environmentally products- water bottles, toothbrushes, combs etc. that were placed in the bathroom were all bio-degradable!   I would 100% recommend staying here- we wish we had time to stay longer!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Shangri-La Hotel Sydney</value></hotel_name><title><value>Lovely hotel but not sure about the service</value></title><content><value>I and 9 of my colleagues had prepaid accommodation.  Even though my room was prepaid I still having a pending amount on my credit card for the accommodation and $200 for possible incidentals.  We all checked out.  My incidentals were then transferred to my boss.  Somehow 3 other</value><value> colleagues' incidentals were also transferred to the boss (with no instructions given by the colleagues to do this).  I have now called the hotel 3 times, left on hold for over 15 mins only to be told then by the Shangrila that they can't get back to me for 3 days as the person who would look after this is out of the office.  Surely there is someone else who could sort this out.  What is strange though is that all 4 of us who have had had incidentals transferred apparently all had the same 4 amounts but no one at the hotel can really tell us what they are.  One of my amounts is for $69.  What is it for, I don't know and neither does the hotel.  Never ever going to that hotel again.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Shangri-La Hotel Sydney</value></hotel_name><title><value>20th Wedding Anniversary</value></title><content><value>We booked the Horizon Club Opera house view room as a splurge for our 20th Wedding Anniversary.   The Hotel was so busy when we arrived that no valet or porter noticed our arrival or even offers to assist us. Hubby asked if an upgrade was available and we were told we were in</value><value> the nicest room which isn’t true.   We had requested an early check in  due to the special occasion but our room was not available until 2pm.  The rooms are in need of a little sprucing up, showers and baths are tiny.   The Horizon club lounge used to have a lovely feel and you were served canapés to your table,  the new “buffet” style canapés was a bit of a disappointment.   We were looking forward to drinks in the Blu Bar on 36. Again because it was so busy service was lacking we would have waited 10 minutes before someone came to take our drink order.   These aren’t things I would usually have a problem with but when you are paying $600++ a night your paying for quality of service, luxury and something extra special.   The views were amazing as always and we were surprised with champagne &amp; and chocolates in our too which was lovely. Service was good with  some lovely finishing touches in the room.   A nice experience but probably won’t stay again in the near future. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

The marble bathroom was lovely, with a great rainfall shower and fragrant Molton Brown toiletries. There was absolutely no street noise, which allowed for a good night's sleep. Always a bonus!  Hotel rates include a very good continental breakfast: juice, muesli, granola, yoghurt, fresh berries etc. Another great feature which we made use of was the honesty bar, which has a decent selection of spirits, wines, beers and snacks.

The room felt open and airy and had a small kitchen. with all</value><value> of the amenities. Its just across the road from Museum train Station ($17 ea fare and a 10 minute or so ride from the airport))The front office staff were friendly and welcoming. Reading some of the reviews here, I fail to understand how some people weren't happy and gave a moaning review. I guess that they may not be happy in life either. We went in with a smile, got a smile back and left with a smile. For dinner we walked a block up Elizabeth Street to the Crown Hotel. Cheap and well presented meals. We will now use Hyde Park Inn as our regular base when we come to Sydney. We highly recommend it. Oh! and the only niggle was that very occasionally we could hear the plumbing which sounded like someone dragging furniture in the next room but it was occasional, lasting for about 5 seconds at a time but was infrequent enough not to worry us.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

The view out of the window was an inner air chamber with a small patch of sky at the top. The king size bed was comfortable and the room was fit for purpose. As a local, I didn't need breakfast at the hotel. The previous night's dinner was eaten after the show at 9.30 pm, but all of the venues around the hotel were either full or closing, so I ate at another hotel a few blocks away. I like going to quiet locations to eat dinner, so the Irish Pub was at full noise at that time of night. The only thing I wasn't pleased with was that I couldn't link up to Wifi with my PC, no matter what time I tried, even the following morning it said I wasn't recognized, so I gave up on it.

<item><hotel_name><value>Medusa</value></hotel_name><title><value>quaint and welcoming</value></title><content><value>Stayed one Saturday night to attend a function close by, and enjoyed the experience of staying in this fashionable boutique hotel among heritage buildings away from busy central Sydney and the Cross. We were upgraded to a Grand Room for the night, which was roomy and</value><value> comfortable. Luke was a wonderful host. The hotel was very easy to get to from the Airport, changing at Central Station on to the Bondi Junction line (using the same Airport Link ticket) and alighting at Kings Cross for a short 5 minute walk up Darlinghurst Road - cheaper than a taxi and probably faster during the day when contending with traffic.  There is no breakfast room; however, there are plenty of cafe and restaurant options close to the hotel - try the bunker cafe for good coffee and light meal selections.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

The train station is literally next to the hotel. There are also plenty of shops and restaurants around. The only caveat with the location is that a couple of the streets are a bit less nice and have some homeless people, so we avoided those when walking around</value><value> with our kids.  The room itself was your standard holiday inn, clean and comfortable. The staff were very nice and helpful and breakfast was really great. There's a juicing station where you can juice your own fruits and vegetables and this was a big hit with our kids.   The gym is quite small but functional.  We booked at the last minute via expedia and it took a little while to find our reservation. But once we got to our room we found a complimentary bottle of wine which was a nice touch.  We only had dinner there one night. There were a couple of mistakes with our order and the food was just OK. I think this may have been because it was late at night and there appeared to be very little staff.  But overall a very pleasant stay.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

The conference facilities were good, with plentiful drinks and our liaison, Jane, was very good.  Would I stay here again - if work, then no issue.

Excellent city location, close to Town Hall station (entrance straight across the road), Queen Victoria Building, Woolworths Supermarket (250m), Cockle Bay Restaurants at Darling Harbour. This time we had a</value><value> studio apartment with views towards the Town Hall.  It was clean &amp; comfortable.  But they let themselves down on so many levels.  They are refurbishing the lifts (and thats good), but the wait times for the only remaining left can be lengthy.  No prior advice of this on any of the booking websites, just a poster at reception.  The poster says they will give you a free mini breakfast if you check-out before 9am, but ours was not provided.  In the rooms there is lots of different types of herbal teas, no ordinary (English Breakfast type) teabags &amp; no milk.

When the reception knew that it was my birthday, they secretly asked my friends what wine I prefer and when I got back to the room, a chilled white wine  was waiting on the dining table with a birthday card.  The suite is highly recommeded for big groups, and the area allows you to accommodate 12 guests for a nightcap.  There is a kitchen, with oven and stove, toaster, microwave.

Both were delicious and unlimited! But a kettle in my room would have been great for a cup of tea before bed.  My room was fairly comfortable although musty smelling. The shower drain had a sewerage smell coming out of it which I</value><value> reported. There was the sound of running water through the night. It's quite loud so perhaps the toilet upstairs. I did not like the location of this hotel. Whilst a main street in Surry Hills, there wasn't a great deal around. A few restaurants on the street itself but that's it. And some dodgy characters hanging around near those restaurants at night.  Lastly there was a mix-up and I got an email to say to contact urgently because I should have checked out but when they went into my room my things were still there.  Their fault.

There is a kitchen with fridge, dishwasher  and cooking facilities and everything in terms of plates, glasses and cutlery that you need.</value><value> The room had a large and comfortable bed for 2, a large bathroom with shower and there were separate washing facilities  (washing machine, dryer, iron and board) as well as a large modern tv and even stereo equipment. The air conditioning unit is new and very quiet. There is a round table that seats 4 and separate easy chairs and sofa in the tv area. The lifts are comfortable and large and the reception doubles as a cosy bar where you can have coffee, drinks and some snacks. Everything is very well organised and very modern, with a lot of  light and space. The hotel is in a very quiet street but close to everything in the city centre, and less than 5 minutes away from a major bus stop that can take you to the beaches and other destinations in the suburbs. The central station is 10 minutes away on foot. Cleaning  is done every day and towel service daily as well. they even top up the supply of washing powder and dishwasher powder.  All in all an excellent choice and very good quality for money.  Public transport in Sydney is very extensive, frequent and very efficiently organised. The easiest way is to buy OPAL cards (in every convenience store), sart by putting 10 AUS$ on it and then top up when necessary. Each time you use public transport you tap the card on a card reader. There are peak periods (9-10.30 and 16.00-18.30) but outside those the prices are really low.

The check-in was seamless and informative. The very big thing was the way he</value><value> interacted with my grand children. The way he presented them with their arrival gifts, particularly after we had all just had a long flight, and an overpriced very long taxi trip from the airport. But that is another story. They kids were happy and excited with the way he presented them to them. . There was then an almost theatrical act as we were given drink vouchers. Thank you very much to this GSA. The room was well presented, the beds were comfortable. The reason we chose this hotel was it's proximity to Central station, Chinatown and Darling harbour. All are just a short walk away, especially when travelling with 8-11 year olds. The reason we travelled was to attend the Hugh Jackman Concert and do some shopping in the "Big Smoke" This hotel was ideally situated for our purpose. All the staff were very well trained and bent over backwards to satisfy our needs. Complaints. (Very minor) 1: perhaps Housekeeping could check behind the curtains and get rid of the spiderwebs and spiders. 2: The shower sounds like a diesel truck using  compression braking when used. 3:Perhaps you have rooms that have a separate shower and bath that are not combined. Some of us prefer a shower that we do not have to climb in and out of Maybe we should have specified this when booking 4: The biggie. The rooms are set up to accommodate 4 people. They need more than 2 coffee cups! As a former Night Auditor of a Novotel resort  (8 years) and currently a Night Manager of a resort , one of your rivals (Not in Sydney) I know what I expect in the way of Guest Relations.

At $330 for 2 nights, we got bed and breakfast for a family of 4 in the heart of Sydney.   Room - on the wish list would be two queen beds instead of  double just for comfort but the pillows were</value><value> good with a pillow menu for fussy sleepers. The shower was over a bathtub which was slightly awkward but other than that there were no real complaints. Adequately sound proofed, clean and everything you need.  Staff - all the staff were super polite and we loved the lady that served us for dinner in the main restaurant. I have forgotten her name now, but she was Peruvian. Asset to the hotel.   Breakfast - one of the best breakfasts that I have had in all my hotel stays all over the world. Good coffee machine and everything you could want or need in a breakfast. Loved it. It was very busy on our second day, but the staff were fantastic during service clearing tables and accommodating such a large volume of clients.  Dinner - was a little pricey, but it is Sydney so not surprising. We ate on the 1st floor as children werent allowed in their other restaurant which was probably the most disappointing part of the whole stay. This was due to Pokie machines in the bottom floor bar/restaurant. It limited our choices and ended up making it a pricey meal. The children's meals were pretty small in the main restaurant and we had to get the kids more food after dinner as they were still hungry. The adult meals were all very nice  Overall a great stay and for the price we paid we have no real complaints, more just a wish list of what could be done better. We would definitely stay here again</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

It wasn’t that long ago we had taken our whole family there for Vivid and were all impressed with the service given to our daughters, their husbands and grand kids. Sydney was</value><value> understandably chaos central so the calm and capable staff were especially appreciated, no where more so in the newly renovated and renamed restaurant Platform 818. Dominic is always impressive in his role and we were again looking forward to his attention on this visit.  From our entry into the building and immediate offer of assistance with our bags down the stairs was both noted and appreciated. Even though my wife is a platinum member of Accor, we noted on numerous occasions how much customer care there was of all patrons. It was also great to catch up with Elizabeth again, who epitomizes this level of care and attention.  Our room on the 13th floor overlooking the busy city vista. The room well appointed though was surprised they didn’t have a stand for our suitcase. The king size bed very comfortable with a pillow menu for added comfort if needed. Nice size TV too, with desk and free wireless. Our room had a bath/shower. The shower suffered from the constant problem with the ‘green friendly’ shower nozzles of too little pressure.   I have to comment on the recently renovated restaurant. The food was incredible, the service outstanding and easily the highlight of our short visit. While Dominic wasn’t there we still had the  the gracious, capable and competent Ann looking after us with Rafael giving support. They always set a high bar but our meal was one of the best we have enjoyed in the whole of Sydney.

Two minutes walk forward from</value><value> there and you are at Circular Quay and ferries to everywhere and stunning views of the Opera House. Add another three minutes (for dragging luggage) and you are at Circular Quay Railway Station where you can get a train directly to Sydney Domestic and International Airport.  Every room is differently decorated but has the staple fresh flowers and chocolates on your pillow at night (with a card that has an appropriate sleep quote on it). You can choose an ensuite room or a room with a shared bathroom. Everything is spotlessly clean. (I tried both options.) Although there is no air conditioning per se there are heaters and fans so you are comfortable at all times. I loved coming home to a light left on for me and a warm room. Extra bonus the windows actually open!! Continental Breakfast is included in your room tariff and even that is done with an extra touch of class....the mini danishes and chocolate croissants are all warmed before serving. There's nothing better than a chocolate croissant with a warm melted choc centre for breakfast. The staff are very pleasant and always helpful.

The food however, is mediocre, nothing to rave about.   The hotel’s breakfast, although offered small selection, the quality is very good, everything was fresh and service is very courteous.   The size of the room and bathroom is good, not too small. And even though they are currently renovating part of the hotel, we didn’t feel it at all.

Arriving on a Sunday at 1900 hours offered a challenge with a lock box key but not hard with instructions well explained. Gift bag with water(?) and oat biscuits was a nice touch though the tap water was delicious so don't see</value><value> the real need to add to the plastic landfill really. Bathroom is extremely small but ok for those who are not claustrophobic. Tea and coffee complimentary in the room was fantastic and appreciated. I usually have to ask the housekeeper for more sugar,coffee, etc but that was not required here. I asked for a late checkout on day three. I was told a $24 fee would be charged for two extra hours!! 10am checkout moved to 12 noon? I thought that was silly and a shame. The lady at the front desk was accommodating by calling our tour operator and was quite helpful. Overall good marks. The area is expensive for eating.

<item><hotel_name><value>The Maisonette</value></hotel_name><title><value>Rude and unhelpful staff. Ruined our first visit to Sydney</value></title><content><value>*I could not find my Google review so I am re-posting this here to help others.  Do not book here. We had a terrible experience at this hotel. As the other bad reviews have mentioned, they have a pretty rude and unhelpful staff.   My daughter used her Agoda account and paid for</value><value> this booking in full via Paypal prior to our trip.   During check-in, they informed us the twin bedroom can only accommodate 2 pax, which we completely understood. So my daughter booked a room in a hotel nearby. My wife and I agreed we will stay at this hotel since it was already paid.   The receptionist then asked for a credit card for the $5 security deposit. We gave my wife's credit card instead since they only accept Visa and Mastercard. (My daughter's card was EPS/Cirrus.)  Once the card was charged successfully, the receptionist gave us the keys to our room. After 20 min, the receptionist called us and told us we need to modify our booking.  We were told even though the room was already fully paid and we provided a working credit card, the booking name has to match the credit card's or they will kick us out.  We were shocked. We can't believe they're doing this over something so trivial!  They could have very easily made this edit in their system. But no, they refused to do that. They made us jump through hoops and contact Agoda ourselves to modify the original reservation.  Agoda was confused too and told us the hotel could have easily done this on their end.   Their lack of "common sense" or helpfulness was truly astounding to us. We've stayed in many hotels around the world and this was the first time we've been treated this way.   They said in their ad they treat guests like family, but that could not be further from the truth. We've honestly never felt more unwelcomed in any establishment.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Hilton Sydney</value></hotel_name><title><value>Superb Service</value></title><content><value>I picked this hotel mainly because we are in Hilton's frequent stayer program, and it seemed like it would be quiet on one of the top floors.  We went with a room that provided access to the executive lounge which had breakfast in the morning and heavy hors d'oeuvres in the</value><value> evening.  I was amazed at how good the service was.  Everyone in this hotel was really friendly, and I mean everyone.  I was not expecting this in a business hotel in a large city.  It made for a very enjoyable stay.  The food in the executive lounge was excellent.  We had enough for breakfast that we didn't need to have lunch, and the hors d'oeuvres were so filling we had no need for dinner either.  So we never got to try any of Sydney's restaurants!  This was just fine with us and we were pretty tired after walking and sightseeing all day.  It was so easy to just get on the elevator and go two floors for dinner.  The location worked very well.  It's near the train station, so we had an easy trip from and to the airport.  If you enjoy walking, you can easily walk to all the top sites in Sydney.  We would definitely stay here again if we ever get back to Sydney.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Hilton Sydney</value></hotel_name><title><value>Ideal family's getaway @ central CBD location</value></title><content><value>This was our first stay at Hilton Sydney with our 7mth old baby, and both my wife &amp; I thoroughly enjoyed our short weekend getaway flying in from Perth.  Check In: We arrived at 2pm, &amp; was offered early access to the Executive Lounge to relax by the very polite Angelica at</value><value> reception while our room was being prepared for check in at 3pm. Sasha at the Concierge/Porter was very helpful and patience to let us access our luggage at storage several times to get our baby's food supplies before check in.  Room: Thanks to my wife's Diamond status, and David Constantine from Parmelia Hilton, we were upgraded to a King Junior Suite on 32flr, a corner room offering lovely floor to ceiling windows with electronically controlled block out blinds.  It was one of the larger rooms at 52sqm and very comfortably furnished with a working desk, sofa, and chaise lounge, complete with a nice comfy baby cot for our baby. The huge King bed was the classic Hilton's serenity range, which my wife thoroughly enjoyed. Only word of cautious I would mention is that the minibar inside the fridge is auto-charging, so be careful while storing your items for chilling during the stay.  Location: It is literally opposite the QVB building, &amp; we walked to Darling Harbour &amp; also Circular Quay within 15-20min. It spans between George &amp; Pitt St, and close to public transport (Town Hall station is less than 5min walk), with Woolworths supermarket within 4 min walk too. We took Uber to &amp; fro the airport, and it took only 30min &amp; cost us $30-$40 each way.  Executive Lounge: They offer Devonshire tea 3-6pm daily (scones with jam &amp; cream which we enjoyed) while evening drinks &amp; canapes are served 6-8pm. There were 2 hot options, changed nightly, as well as a choice of salads, cold meats &amp; cheese. There is a bartender to serve up a selection of complimentary wines, beer, spirits, soft drinks &amp; also tea/coffee etc during the evening. We found it was really crowded on Sat evening, with limited hot canapes, while Sun was a nice quiet change.   Breakfast: We chose to have the buffet breakfast at the Glass on 2nd floor, which was very spacious &amp; offer beautiful view from the glass walls. There was ample of hot &amp; continental Hilton breakfast, and while the Western selection was impressive, we felt the Asian selection could have been enhanced besides the limited coogee, fried rice &amp; fried dumpling. The staff on both days were excellent, especially Mhkyra who is always smiling, and Ryan, who despite being an intern waitperson, tried his best to make us feel valued, as we had the added challenge of feeding our baby during breakfast  We would be happy to stay here again on our next trip to Sydney.

We were upgraded to two bedroom without consultations because of unsympathetic  and bad behaviour from management.  Then suffered with no air for the time we were there recovering from a medical issue.  The parking was an inconvenient 10 min walk away $45 per day. For the tiniest spot.   The walk to get the car is past 20 dirty smelly dustbins . Very steep and dangerous as the rubbish was on the driveway and been washed down with water making it very dangerous.   Do not stay here.

We</value><value> did not have to share a bathroom with another room and breakfast was included in the family owned café downstairs.   We were two couples so we needed 2 rooms (it is a 9-room hotel). One room had a queen size bed and a twin bed while the other room had a queen size bed and two twin beds. The beds were very comfortable and there was a wall air-conditioning unit in each room. It is also only a 4 minute walk to an excellent Hop-On Hop-Off Big Bus Tour stop (which we also signed up for).  Note that the rooms are on the first and second floors and there are no elevators if you are on the second floor. In both of our rooms, the fans did not work well at all, and in one room, the air conditioner worked well but was very noisy. Other than that, for the reasonable money we paid, we had clean, comfortable rooms with kitchenettes and newly renovated bathrooms.

There was no room folio so we were a bit in the dark as to what the hotel offered. The room had been brightened-up but the hotel is still 1980's drab. The entrance to the pool area is particularly unimpressive ... a sort of motel experience rather than Four Seasons or Shangri-La.

As soon as we entered the hotel, we were greeted by the friendly porters and check in was fast and smooth. When we entered our room, the first thing we saw was the cot that we had requested. It was already prepared for bub and there was a lovely Kangaroo stuff toy gift! He absolutely loved it! We took a short nap and checked out the infinity pool and the view was stunning! When we got back to our room, there was a lovely note from the Sofitel Team and sweets treats! We got an amazing view of the harbour and it was a dream! We sprayed the special Sofitel linen spray and the bed felt like you were on clouds! From checkin to checkout, our experience was wonderful and will definitely come back. This is what you call luxury and service from the heart.

Be that as it may, this place that to be shared. 1. You must want to stay in Bondi.  2. You are looking for an</value><value> Australian beach house experience. If you tick yes to both these then look no further than the Bondi Beach House. It is short walk to the main beach front strip of Bondi and from there all of Bondi is within easy walking distance, the beach, restaurants, cafes, shops, the lot The  longer majestic coastal walks , both north and south, begin and end here too. The accommodation is spotlessly clean and full of Aussie beach side character. It is not an impersonal 5 star hotel but an intimate personal home of your own for as long as you stay. All I can conclude is check out their website and book. We have been there twice within the past 6 months and will be there again.

The property continues to be well maintained, beautifully appointed and well equipped.  We appreciated the in unit laundry. Our unit this trip was on the Pyrmont  Street side which we found to have a great layout but be a bit noisier than the units on the other side of the building.  The roof top patio is a great space to relax when the weather permits and there is cooking facilities there - we did not use them this time.  Helen is most helpful and easily accessible for any questions, recommendations or problems one might have.    This property is a wonderful place to stay when visiting Sydney and we highly recommend it.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

They've never had a problem looking after bags for early or late departures, arranging transport, or suggesting a place to</value><value> eat. Rooms are a strange shape, by virtue of the remodelling of the existing building, but they are big, quiet and very comfortable. The location is not quite in the centre of anything - the streets around are the financial area so tend to be quiet after dark. But that gives you a nice quiet sleep, and it's only a very short walk to the Quay, the Opera House or the Botanic Gardens. I rarely order room service, much preferring to discover the local restaurants, but the one night I was trapped here by a late arrival and weather, the curry I ordered for dinner was superb, and the serve huge.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Bondi Backpackers</value></hotel_name><title><value>Central hostel with a great view</value></title><content><value>I stayed for six nights at Bondi Backpackers while waiting on a visa in Sydney, decided to mix up my view and get out of the CBD for awhile.  Bondi Backpackers is a young hostel, but very social and clean, with an incredible view of Bondi beach across the street.  As of August</value><value> 3, the hostel is still under construction (as it is being fully updated and remodeled) but the final work is mostly cosmetic, such as painting. Unfortunately, the workers do still start early (7am) and can be loud in the hallways but most of the really dirty obtrusive work is done.   Compared to Wake Up Sydney and Wake Up Byron Bay, the hostel is snug on space, which comes with the location and view.   My only issues were that the kitchen can be REAL SNUG during meal times to cook and eat, and that the food storage was never checked or cleaned out so finding a locker for dry food could be tough. As someone who is working remotely during part of my trip, I would have also liked more table seating to work. Both the downstairs common area and the 4th floor have none of that indoors, and during winter sitting at the table outside could be too chilly.   Staff is nice and helpful, and the rooms have good storage and plugs/lights by each bed, a must!  Overall, would stay here again and would recommend it. Once the construction work is finished, it will be a really nice hostel option in Sydney.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

These came in handy - Proper coffee pod machine (no Nescafe sachets!) - They seem to be environmentally conscious (no plastic water bottles, recycled toilet paper)  Some critiques: - As no one was at the desk at checkout, I rang the number provided.

<item><hotel_name><value>InterContinental Sydney Double Bay</value></hotel_name><title><value>Excellent hotel but let down by dining room</value></title><content><value>Most of my stay at this hotel was very enjoyable: the building and location is excellent; bedroom (classic twin double) was spacious, quiet, clean, cosy, and beds were firm  and comfortable (a great night's sleep). Concierge and reception staff excellent -- so friendly, alert,</value><value> professional.   The let down was at breakfast. The room allotted to guests for breakfast is too small. It felt very cramped given the number of people being ushered into the space. The room itself is grim, without character, messy, bland, small -- which is a shame given the dimensions of the hotel and most other spaces in the hotel. I was taken to my table only to find it covered in the previous occupant's mess. The waitress then grabbed a nearby damp (hygiene?) cloth, gave the table two wipes, and then barely set the table again (missing spoons). Compounding the discomfort was that some breakfast items ran out and weren't replaced (or maybe at a much longer interval than seen). It was more like a cafeteria experience than a breakfast at a five star hotel.Just not good enough for a five star  hotel offering a Winter special with breakfast as a feature, especially as there are excellent alternatives outside of the hotel in Double Bay.  Oh well. As I said, everything else was excellent.  It was like two different hotels: the breakfast area as one, the rest of the hotel as the other.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

At 10.30am i hadnt heard anything, (i had paid $65 for parking and had to leave for work already). I called again and this time someone else tells me they dont think there's anything they can do.   Wish i'd booked at Quest, just a couple buildings down the road, was a little bit more expensive per night but they have 24 hour reception and had the same $30 parking voucher deal, so would have worked out same cost and probably better, more comfortable experience.

<item><hotel_name><value>Megaboom City Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Great value for money and central</value></title><content><value>I booked the Megaboom city hotel a few months in advance on Agoda and paid £59 per night for a single room. At the time it was the cheapest central hotel in Sydney I could find, the others were quite a bit more expensive. At street level you have to use the elevator to go to</value><value> floor 1 which is where the reception is. Even though I was there at 10am the staff offered to keep my luggage while I could explore the city and even managed to get my room ready before the official check in time of 2pm. My room was quite compact size being a single but had a great rain forest shower, tea &amp; coffee facilities and a fridge. It was quiet throughout my stay with no noise disturbances. Other reviewers moan that you have to enter the stairs of the internal fire escape to reach the single rooms (literally for 2-3 seconds) - this is correct however its absolutely no bother at all and does not feel excluded or separated from the hotel in any way whatsoever - the room numbers are well signposted. The hotel is extremely central on York street just opposite the Queen Victoria building and you have metro stops either side of the hotel a few minutes walk away. There are plenty of restaurants, shops near the hotel and I can personally recommend 'IPOH TOWN' malaysian restaurant/take away seconds from the hotel, fabulous food and cheap too. It took me around 15 minutes to walk down to Circular Quay for the Opera house, Harbour bridge area etc. Staff were pleasant and helpful during my stay, room was cleaned daily. I would definitely recommend the Megaboom City hotel.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

Recommend this as a short break if you like the bush  to sit on your balcony watching the boats on the harbour or to be more active as we were and explore some of the natural beauty that was right on our doorstep as Sydneysiders.

The hotel is in a great location just a five minutes walk from Kings Cross where you can easily catch the tram to anywhere in the city. Also very close to Hyde Park.

There is also a bus stop right outside the hotel and a Metro shop across the road for all your grocery needs which you can store in the fridge in your hotel room. There is also a little cafe in the reception area. I didn’t have breakfast in the hotel. It was quite expensive so we ate out instead. The room was very spacious and clean but decor was very dated. They advertise as a ‘posh high-rise hotel’ but they are most certainly not in any way ‘posh’. The elevators are a disaster. You have to swipe your key card to access your floor but it’s very temperamental. It’s a great hotel but for the price you pay to stay you would expect much more modern facilities.

<item><hotel_name><value>Establishment Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Staff excellent, location fantastic but actual experience a bit of a let down...</value></title><content><value>Booked a weekend getaway at the Establishment...we hadn’t stayed there before so we thought it looked good for somewhere different, it looked and sounded fantastic online.   Some really good aspects: location is excellent for getting down to Circular Quay, the staff - extremely</value><value> friendly and welcoming, the building is an old building which has been modernised and as such had a pretty cool feel, the room was a great size as was the ensuite, the bed was very comfortable.   The parts which let the overall experience down: from around 4pm till around 1am the public wine bar downstairs becomes a full on club (albeit an upmarket club), if loud beats and inebriated patrons are your thing - you’ll love it, (if however you find some of that a bit irritating then I would suggest booking elsewhere), elements of the updated property are now looking tired and in need of attention (particularly the rest rooms in the public areas which were frankly a disgrace), the breakfast buffet was very poor with very little choice on offer. So in my opinion the Establishment failed to deliver in reality what it promised when viewed online ... shame cause it could be truly great.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Ibis Sydney King Street Wharf</value></hotel_name><title><value>Great Location</value></title><content><value>I just had an AMAZING weekend at this hotel. The Ibis is walking distance from Wynyard Station and easily accessible from Sydney Airport. When we arrived we took the long route from the station which was straight down, the very steep, Erskine Street.  We arrived before 1pm and</value><value> were told we could check-in early which was amazing. (The desk clerk also told us a MUCH faster/easier way back to the train station.) My husband had upgraded our room to a King but it was a lot smaller than what we were expecting. It contained a 'short' king size bed (ridiculously comfortable!), a bench under a narrow window with one chair, an open single closet which also had the kettle in it and a very small bar fridge. The ensuite was also small but serviceable. There was not that much space around the bed and I'm glad we only had one small suitcase each as there wasn't enough room for much more. The floors were wood grain vinyl and not that nice considering it is winter and we didn't have slippers!  There is a bar downstairs in the foyer and a small cafe which is where you get your breakfast each morning. (If you've paid for it in advance) Our prepaid breakfast option entitled us to a choice of three items off the menu. This was then prepared for us and served to us in the bar. Very nice and fresh. On our last day we were leaving early so we pre-ordered our breakfast and this was waiting for us when we came downstairs. (No hot food available at the hour we were leaving.)  The hotel is so close to the King Street Wharf that you probably won't spend much time in your hotel. The Ibis is located on a corner and you can see the wharf from it. You walk out the door, cross a small road, walk the length of one building, cross another small road and you're at the wharf!  The wharf precinct is full of restaurants and bars and really comes alive at night. This is also where a lot of restaurant, tourist and party cruises are based. Most importantly, it's where you can catch a ferry. We didn't use the trains the whole weekend but used our Opal card to catch ferries everywhere!   The staff at the Ibis are very friendly and the location is perfect for a fun-filled, relaxed weekend. Try one of the wharf restaurants for a great meal and jump on a ferry to the Opera House.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

Roof top bar has incredible views over the harbour, just beautiful, the only downside to that as a hotel</value><value> guest, you can't sleep in past 7am as the staff sound like a small herd of elephants as they clean and prepare for the day. Just mentioning also and look it wasn't a HUGE deal, even though I had to cancel my bank card, this Hotel did attempt to take the full booking amount out a few times, after paid in full. Bit of a stuff up on their end and to be honest they could've handled that ALOT BETTER, manager was a bit rude, so be careful there. But all in all the hotel is a lovely old building.

Walk to Paddy's market and Chinatown, walk to city shopping, easy access from airport. Take train from airport to Central - buy an Opal ticket if you don't already have one, then take the train to Museum station. Its only a 5 minute easy walk down Elizabeth St and you are there. They now have FREE WiFi. Rooms comfortably furnished with good beds and pillows. Reception area has been revamped and looks great with a comfortable lounge area. Also you can borrow umbrellas from reception. However, it seemed that there were too many staff in reception, working at cross purposes. Instead of being checked in quickly and efficiently, your room keys are given to another staff member whose job it is to talk you in to going to a presentation - called an update!

Very warm welcome at reception and offer of a late checkout.  Room was available prior to stated check in time so that was a bonus.  Room was comfortable, well appointed and clean.  Bed was good and the mix of pillows was appreciated.  First day’s breakfast</value><value> was frenetic.  Clearly the breakfast space isn’t big enough to cater for the most popular breakfast times.  The hotel actually has a notice stating the busy times and the potential wait times.  In my view, clients should be able to have a comfortable breakfast experience at whatever time suits them rather than work around the hotel’s short comings in terms of space.  The breakfast choices are good - if you can actually access them without being pushed and shoved around by other guests who apparently have no clue about waiting their turn!  Second day, we went to breakfast early which was a better experience.  However, at these prices, I expect to be able to eat in comfort at a time that suits me rather than what suits the hotel. We ordered room service for dinner both nights.  First night was really good.  Second night was a debacle.  We did not get what we ordered.  I called the room service manager who appeared to be well aware that this was the case.  I stress, the food we got was good...... it it was NOT what we ordered.  The manager agreed to take the cost off our bill.  I appreciate that but I would rather have received what we ordered and would have been more than happy to pay.  It can’t be that hard surely?  As far as location, it was perfect for us as we were attending the boat show.  The room was very quiet despite the location.  We would stay again.  I really think they need to look at their room service and the inadequate space in the breakfast room.  </value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

The hotel is large &amp; looks lovely from the outside. Across the way from paddies market &amp; close to many restaurants. We walked all over Sydney city from here and never felt scared or threatened when walking around at</value><value> night. Check in was easy &amp; went smoothly. They held our bags as we arrived early morning. We stayed on level 4. As you get off the lifts there is a funky smell. I put it down to the carpet. It looks clean but it’s  still carpet. The king bed is actually 2 kingsingles pushed together. This causing a crevice in the middle. The shower only has half shower screen so water goes out the shower &amp; over the bathroom floor. The room is a decent size with a comfy chair to sit by the window. The aircon is quite &amp; you cant hear noise from other rooms. Breakfast: if you don’t get there by 7.30am expect to wait. The line up was long &amp; we waited about 20mins. Once in the restaurant it’s very hot &amp; over crowded. But at least you can get barista coffee &amp; eggs cooked to your liking. There is a large range of food hot &amp; cold available. There is skim or full cream milk only available. If you have intolerances  like I do. The only other option when I asked was soy milk..

First impressions from the outside is that it is lacking maintenance, you will see many examples of painting over flaking paint.The reception is</value><value> non existent. You knock on a door and when is opened you enter some sort  some sort of staff rest room with a desk against the wall. My wife wanted to leave! The staff are very friendly, no complaints at all. We were allocated a room in a building opposite on the third floor. Carrying two cases at 30kgs up three flights of stairs is no joke so if you are booking, request a ground floor room. The room was very clean, the sheets/towels etc pristine and it was the best bed we had slept in during our stay, sort of a Queen Bed I would guess. We did not have a car but parking is very limited and you would have to be good to get in and out without a '49 point turn'! Last tip. The key they give you does not lock the door, it only opens it. You have to push the button in on the inside door handle and then just close it. If it had a reception, and some more care it could easily move to 4/5 stars. Finally, if you were using at as a  base it looked to have everything you could need for a longer stay, like a self contained room really.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

Pros: the location is good, the property is well managed, the guests are very nice and generally</value><value> quiet. I did have a comfortable stay overall. Wifi worked well.  Cons: there is a children's daycare next door that can be very loud after 08:30. The kitchen stovetop range does not work very well (only a couple burners work) and the kitchen closes early at 9:30 pm. And while the private bathrooms were nice to have, I found mine a bit disappointing: when you shower, the whole bathroom gets wet, and in high humidity it does not dry. Water pressure for sink &amp; shower was uneven and sometimes there was not enough hot water.  I've visited Sydney and Manly several times over the years and am comparing to other places I've stayed at, with comparable prices.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Oaks Goldsbrough Apartments</value></hotel_name><title><value>DO NOT STAY HERE</value></title><content><value>Pictures of the room look nice. (We had 2x). They are not.  The rooms feel unclean. Unkept. Un loved and dated. First room well we would have had more sleep if we had slept in the street as that’s how it felt we did not get one wink of sleep all night. Feels like your on the</value><value> freeway every car bike bus and lorry wakes you up. And they are all night. The bathroom tiles wet broken. The kitchen units were hanging off. The bath had a hole in it. The carpets stained and the kitchen not fit to cook for a dog in. Also he neighbor were young kids partying late and you cane here every word said shouted and screamed.   We complained the next morning and the staf who were very apologetic said they would move us to a refurbished room. We just had to hang around for 2hours while they prepared the room (2hours of our weekend here lost) Two hours later no room. Show another alternative in the penthouse. That was no better and if that what is classed. As a penthouse I would have been disgusted.  We finally got our replacement room after 3hours (half the day now lost)  The room we swapped to has in their opinion been refurbished. In my opinion no different that the previous one. Other than the utilities were not stainless steel. Still unkept. Unloved and not feeling clean at all. The tiles weren’t cracked but the units in the bathroom were now hanging off. The toilet flushed intermittently the tv didn’t work only by hand at the tv remotes useless. He second night the traffic noice was better as he room was now the furthers from the highway however you can still hear it. Even with the complimentary ear plugs (why?). That said at 4am the fire alarm went off and the building was evacuated. Another night with no sleep (Thanks for such a relaxing break) this happed as someone Burt some soars in one of the many hundreds of apartments after a night out..   The noise all night long from the corridor due to he open plan is also unbearable you can here every part of every conversation on every floor from all the people coming in late form their nights out all night long.   FAMILIES REALLY BEED TO STAY CLEAR OF THIS PLACE.   The pop up bed in both rooms was awful and you couldn’t sleep in it. As said would here been better in THE street.   The pool looks lovely in the pics and it is. Or least it was the last time they cleaned it. The floor was filthy and not fit to walk on in my opinion well not without shoes  The location however on the harbour is good. You can’t see it unless in a penthouse room but you can access it from the 2nd floor over a walkway. (Perfect).  Well the walkway takes you into a multi-storey car park on the 4th floor first (the car park smells very strongly of urine I might add) you can’t then take the elevator down cross the tram lines over the road up the street then your in the harbour. Or further down the car park across another walk way into the shopping complex half way back up, go down the escalator another half way walk back to the doors then your in the harbour so not quite near it.   I can not tell you how upset we are that any holiday company would put anyone in this place. (Thanks Gold medal).

I have a very good sleep at night, my room was at level 5 , no</value><value> noise , no smell from restaurants around  and extremely clean !! The staffs are very nice and helpful, I forgot their names but I think both are Indian ethnics. She even check if everything is ok with my room . The man after her shift also very kind and help my issue with the heater immediately  Both deserve credits for their warmth welcome and being very nice and helpful to the guests.  The toilletries are pretty good qualities, only there's no toothbrush provided, but I always bring my own anyway so it wasnt a problem. Kitchen equipment also available. Easy to walk  everywhere in  CBD area also Paddys Market and Darling Harbour . I moved to Marriot hotel for the next two days, but to be honest I prefered to stay here based on the room facilities.  I strongly recommend this hotel apartment especially when u travel with family members, and I will definitely stay here again if I visit Sydney in the future.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Liv Apartments</value></hotel_name><title><value>Absolutely appauling service!!</value></title><content><value>I am absolutely disgusted with how I have been treated my Liv Apartments Staff particularly the Women named Kelly from the Darling Harbour Complex.   I booked their Penthouse for an event in August via bookings.com full stop new line when I was completing my booking it gave me</value><value> the option to pay later which I selected assuming I would need to pay a deposit. when I got an email stating that they had tried to charge my credit card I rang them to find out the policy around payment to ensure our accommodation with secure. Kelly was the one I spoke to who was quite abrupt and rude and said that they only accept full payment. I explained that a Pay Later option was available and asked if a deposit could be left and I will try and sort something out and she reluctantly said she would speak to her manager and get back to me she made it clear that she would give me till Friday to pay the full amount or she wouldn't cancel my reservation. I haven't got a call back so I called this morning as she said I had till Friday. when I called the number I went through too some kind of Hotline that told me I had to email the apartment and they gave me the email address. Apparently they prefer to communicate via Email than over the phone. so because of this and the fact that every time I rang I spoke to a new person I sent a brief email explaining the situation and that I thought I could pay later and ask for someone to contact me. Kelly then rang me and rudely accused me of complaining that I couldn't pay later and demanded that I paid the full fee. I explained to her that I didn't have it at the time and I was in the middle of organising it and that if she could give me till after lunch I should be able to pay the full amount after that call ended about 10 minutes or so later I got an email saying my accommodation had been cancelled. because she called me a for mobile number I returned her call and inquired as to why my accommodation was cancelled Kelly then denied cancelling my accommodation and suggested that the manager had done it. however throughout the day when I've asked to speak to a manager there has never been one available. so I decided to send an email because by this time I was frustrated and annoyed we've had been treated and spoken to. I think got a call back from Kelly saying that it was cancelled automatically because I didn't pay by Friday being today which surprises me because originally Kelly had told me that if I didn't make full payment by today she would cancel it so that alone is conflicting enough. like I said I would I arranged the full amount to pay for the accommodation and our early check in and late check out and after speaking to booking.com and them trying to contact Kelly I also tried to call her. I found it odd that my call was being ignored and decided I try of a private number where my call was then answered the moment she heard my voice she hung up on me. I tried numerous amount of times to call and again was hung up on constantly. I also emailed and was basically called a liar in regards to how I was treated and what was said to me. We were willing to pay $ 815 for our stay for one night however now I do not feel comfortable going near the complex or ever booking in the future. I've never experienced such a poor customer service in my life and highly do not recommend this apartment. I can't believe how hard it was just to try and book a room and the fact that I was offered an additional service that apparently is not offered through the apartment there was no compassion for the misunderstanding. I would also like to point out that not all accommodation offers a Pay Later option so this is obviously something that they can choose to have on their profile when you're making a booking and they can also choose to have it removed. What frustrates me even more is in their cancellation email their payment policy is that you must leave a 50% deposit and have the last 50% paid within thirty days of your stay I was booking for the 3rd of August to the 4th of August so realistically according to their policy I should have been allowed to leave a 50% deposit and should have been allowed to pay the rest off by the 3rd of July. Very disgusting and disgraceful behaviour coming from one an adult to a hospitality professional and three someone that works in customer service if I could give negative stars I would.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Oaks Hyde Park Plaza</value></hotel_name><title><value>Close to the trains for easy access to the rest of the city but the rooms are not as presented.</value></title><content><value>The bathroom had mold in the tub, and the bathroom was unsanitary.  I dropped my wet bar of soap in between the tub and the vanity and when I picked it up there was enough hair and dirt on it to make a new koala.  The air-conditioner needed to be serviced and the smell in the</value><value> hallway was terrible!  It costs 8.00 to do a load of laundry and that does not include the cost of soap.  You will also need to stay with your laundry while it is being done.   There was a language barrier with some of the staff but the one young woman that works during the day was great.  She helped us figure out the busing system to get to the mall.   There's easy access to the hotel through the trains. You can take a train from the airport and get off at the Museum station.  Its just a short walk up the hill and you are there.    Between the train and the hotel is the war museum which is free and pretty somber.  It's open during the day.  There is also a bus, that is very closely located to the hotel,  that you can take to a HUGE shopping center if you are interested in shopping.    The maintenance staff attended to the air-conditioner right away.  It was very difficult to get information from the staff on restaurants in the area.  An example would be how the front desk staff said she was unaware of any high-end steak house and there was one next door to the hotel. They also could not tell us which pizza places were around and that would deliver.    There is a rooftop pool but the picture above must have been from when the building was first built because that's not what it looks like today.  You cannot see out the glass as it's dirty.  The pictures of the room that were provided through Expedia were also incorrect.    The best thing about the hotel is the location.  </value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

David was super helpful and communicative and I felt that if I ever needed anything, he'd be there. I didn't need much though as the room was</value><value> very comfortable (loved the Victorian-style furnishings!) and the B&amp;B itself is in a great area close to shops, restaurants and cafes but far enough away from the main streets that its quiet to sleep at night. I didn't use the kitchen much but it was well stocked for anyone who would like to. I chose a bedroom with a shared bathroom and never had any issues with using the washroom when needed. The bathroom is really lovely and bright - I enjoyed watching the parrots in the trees in the morning just outside! I liked meeting the other guests who were staying there as well.

We stayed in the ensuite room, very comfortable bed and fantastic shower with plentiful hot water.

Fantastic restaurants in house (Poly is delicious and the coffee at PCP is excellent) and the surrounding area. Paramount Fitness Club: yoga, fitness classes and a nice cafe on the rooftop. Although if you’re looking for a treadmill, spin or elliptical machines etc, there’s other gyms (Fitness First) nearby.   This is my second stay, first stay (Jan/Feb) Housekeeping was fantastic. During this stay, they were exceptionally slack. Returned to my room at 4pm to find the room not serviced and nonchalant in response when I complained.

<item><hotel_name><value>Paramount House Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>A stylish boutique hotel with much to offer.</value></title><content><value>The hotel is an excellent location in Surry Hills, a short leisurely walk to Hyde Park and in a quiet enclave away from the hustle and bustle of the CBD. For a boutique hotel, it has plenty to offer including an excellent on-site restaurant called Poly, the hipster cafe in the</value><value> lobby serving great coffee, an arts cinema in the basement, a gorgeous coworking space in its mezzanine, and a fitness centre and social space in its rooftop.  The highlight of my stay was, however, the service from its staff. They were friendly, accommodating as well as attentive all at the same time. They might not have some of the essentials that I needed like shaving cream but they did their very best to accommodate my needs.  The hotel, of course, is famous for its design as widely seen in social media and glossy periodicals. Needless to say, the loft where I stayed in was beautiful however one can say it is more form over function. For one there isn't a desk if you needed to work. The wooden bathtub/shower is in the middle of the room enclosed only by a shower curtain. There is really no proper wardrobe to hang clothes and the only "storage" is a small area under the stairs. The small outdoor balcony though is a nice feature. It may also be a personal preference but I am not a huge fan of the beddings used.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Paramount House Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Hipster paradise- form over function</value></title><content><value>I had been bursting to stay at this hotel and after months of ogling it on Instagram I booked a Sunny room for a night alone in the city. I have to say, I was underwhelmed.  The positives- aesthetically, it is a delight. Straight off the pages of the coolest hipsters instagram.</value><value> Trendy upon trendy for every design aspect. The shower was good, and the products were lovely. Free movies, although the selection was pretty rubbish and the tv kept freezing.   The negatives- I just felt it was all about the look and not the comfort or practicality. As has been mentioned over and over, the NOISE is crazy. Other historic hotels that I have stayed at like Ovolo and QT have managed to negate the noise and I have never been disturbed but this was next level. Yes, Surry Hills is noisy but so is Pitt st and the QT doesn't have noise like this. 100% they have skimped on noise reduction and focused on looking cool.  I had a sunny room. There was pretty much no natural light that reaches the room. There is a very high balcony you cannot see over unless you're on your toes and structural elements that prevent the light coming in. I had visions of sitting on the day bed in the sun, but there is no chance of that ever happening.  The small details that make a hotel somewhere you want to be and want to come back to were not there. The tea situation- what is that? Just give a few more tea bags. The 'handcraft' mugs again look great but they are clunky and uncomfortable. I know this seems petty but it was these little things that meant it wasn't the experience of comfort that I was hoping for.   If you are in your 20's, and you want to be seen with the cool team, this is the hotel for you. If you are after a comfortable stay at an interesting hotel, the QT and Ovolo do it much better.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Quality Apartments Camperdown</value></hotel_name><title><value>Okay</value></title><content><value>My flight from Sydney to Melbourne got cancelled late at night and there were no other flights that night so I booked this while waiting in line at the service desk at the airport to reschedule my flight. I didn't wait for the airline to book me into a hotel as they sent me a</value><value> text saying I could book one myself and be reimbursed up to $150. I was also reimbursed taxi fares and a meal.  I actually ended up booking this place by mistake. I was was in such a fuss that I selected the wrong place on wotif. never mind.  The apartment was $139. Check in was OK. Certainly not unfriendly at all. The desk clerk gave me helpful recommendations on where to get a late night pub meal and a few beers. The building is about 200 metres across the street and then down the road, near the hospital. Needless to say I didn't spend much time there as I was gone by 5am the next morning. One thing I did notice was stains on the ceiling, but the bed was comfortable enough and the shower was fine. The celing fan in the bedroom had little effect, however, even with the air-con cranked up as high as it could go. Consequently I was a little warm during the night, but perhaps it was just me.

<item><hotel_name><value>Hotel Ravesis</value></hotel_name><title><value>A bar, not a hotel</value></title><content><value>Ravesis is a bar, plain and simple; their hotel effort is a joke. They have a ‘pokie room’ that allows smoking which permeates the lobby and reception area (nice ‘welcome’ ugh), they play outrageously loud music that literally shakes the building until late at night (thank</value><value> goodness for the white noise app), and basically the staff is grossly undertrained to operate a hotel. It’s unfortunate that all of the money spent on swanky room design and smart branding is for not when you arrive to a sloppy, unmanned desk (and a grouchy bartender with no desire to help), an expensive (overpriced!) “ocean front” room that really just offers a peek-a-boo ocean view down the street and an awkward room with the bathroom on the lower level and the rest of the room above with a steep, winding stairway in between (both inconvenient and semi-dangerous). And a $50 charge for a one-hour late check out request? Um no.  We couldn’t check out fast enough!! Only reason for two stars is that it’s a convenient location with lots of restaurants nearby and the beach is just a short walk. Room was nicely decorated but still overshadowed by negative energy from staff.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Siesta Sydney</value></hotel_name><title><value>Great location... great price.</value></title><content><value>I'll be honest. My first impression of the Siesta was not great. The facility and rooms are very average. The place was clean but its totally bare bones with no frills for sure. We stayed for 3 nights and, by the end of our stay, we were sold on the Siesta. The location is</value><value> fantastic... a short walk to the ferries or train. Lots of restaurants close by... but we took the ferries almost everywhere. For the price and convenience you'd be hard pressed to find a better option. Basic kitchen facilities are available and we cooked several meals after stopping at the Coles grocery that is close by. This is located in the busy business district so expect city noise. Free laundry was a nice bonus.  If I had a complaint it would be the bathrooms and showers. Though plenty hot and clean, they would rank right up there with the least convenient I have every used. There is nowhere to but your cloths/toiletries when you're in the shower and really nowhere to put stuff outside the shower either. Its a crap layout. The showers are horrible. They need to add lots of hooks and some shelves to keep your things up and dry while you shower.   The convenience and cost make the Siesta a 4 out of 5. I'd definitely recommend it.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

So forget about calling</value><value> home or even watching a video on YouTube.  Most of the staff where nice although one (who I believe could be the Manger) was rude to my girlfriend when she asked to use the internet Cafe computers. Although they where clearly free he flat out rejected her. He also loves the sound of his own voice and is the tannoy daily disturbing you  Rule wise. Check out is 9am! What even is that haha? If  you want to cook you have to go to reception to ask to use the pots and pans... They also clean the bathrooms at like 8am so if you are wanting a shower before checkout or before work it is a large in convenience.  Decent room but that is about that.

<item><hotel_name><value>Jolly Swagman Backpackers</value></hotel_name><title><value>Good overall, with some annoying quirks</value></title><content><value>Kitchen, bathrooms, and rooms were all clean. Beds weren't bad for hostel bunkbeds. Employees were all very friendly. Location was good, with easy access to train station. However, a few things were unexpected and quite annoying compared to other hostels: 1) 9am checkout. Who</value><value> does that? 10 seems to be the industry standard, so 9am just feels like you're getting shorted. 2) Kitchen closes at 9am for cleaning. This is just a pain. Most people are still using it at this time. You also aren't allowed to cook after 9.30pm, so no late night meals, if you're into that. 3) You have to go to the front desk to borrow cookware and have to pay a dollar deposit to use a coffee mug. Just ridiculous. I've stayed at hostels all over the world and never encountered this before. 4) There are lockers to store luggage in for the day after checkout, but you have to pay for them and they are fairly small. I was able to fit a 45L pack and a mid size duffel. If you have a large suitcase, it's unlikely to fit. I would have rated this hostel 4 or 5 stars, but for the above inconveniences it only gets 3. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

By far the worst I have ever stayed in. My initial room had dirty bed linen - stained sheets and pillow cases that smelled of body odour and were covered in human hair. I asked for clean bed linen and was told by the receptionist that housekeeping wouldn't</value><value> be available until the morning. I then asked to be moved to a different room. The receptionist reluctantly agreed. The room I was moved to was even worse. A pungent sewage smell was coming out of the bathroom. This time, the receptionist claimed that she "couldn't smell anything" ... but then offered to bring me air freshener. I insisted to be moved to a room with clean bed linen that didn't smell like faeces. Apparently, "all the rooms were booked". I did a quick search on the Ryals Hotel website and proved the receptionist was lying. When I asked to speak with the manager, the receptionist begrudgingly offered to change the dirty bed linen in the first room herself. The following morning, I raised my complaint about this horrible experience with the manager. Her response was, "oh yes, I've discussed it with my staff, I hope we'll do better next time and you'll give us another chance". Absolutely not!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

The surfaces were worn down, bathrooms were of old standard and there were a lot of signs of water damage from the shower and windows that had not been properly fixed, only repainted. Extensive mould. </value><value> The worst experiences from this stay were dealing with their staff. I have travelled in most parts of the world but have never encountered a place of business more lacking in communication skills, reliability, honesty, professional conduct and decency as Manly Surfside. These ladies do not appear to have the competence or the person skills to be a part of a tourist business.  My best advice is to choose any other company for your stay in Manly. But if you choose M.S, be sure to get everything important in writing up front. Double-check and ask to confirm everything important, like appointments. I wish I had recorded the conversations I had with their staff, they would go viral because of the impertinence and lack of professional conduct. They don´t seem to have any limitations to how far they will go in rudeness, including harassment and plain threats (!). My encounter with Manly Surfside rates to a single star, but I give them two because Manly is the nicest place ever. As long as you avoid having anything to do with these people you will have a fantastic stay in Manly.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

It gave me the peace and clarity I was looking for in my getaway and far exceeded all of</value><value> my expectations. Amanda and Benny were just wonderful, sweet people- those people that inspire you for living their passion, and who you want to be friends with. They set up a perfect itinerary for my stay, incorporating morning yoga on the beach, bootcamp workouts, massages, organic spray tans and much more! They gave great recommendations for places to eat and explore in Bondi, and made delicious breakfasts every morning..I still want that frittata recipe.   I am constantly lusting over the events and retreats that they are holding and cannot wait until my next trip.The ONLY negative aspect of Bondi Yoga House is its distance from NYC..but that will not stop me from returning.  Highly recommend!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Darling Street Apartments</value></hotel_name><title><value>Great apartment in Rozelle.</value></title><content><value>We stayed with Gillian two different times on our trip down under. She has two apartments out in Rozelle for rent. Lots of room, great bathroom and good AC. You are a little ways out of Sydney, but if you walk up to Victoria Road and catch any bus heading into Sydney, it will</value><value> let you off in the middle of the city. Walk up Darling Street until you hit Victoria Road, cross at the lights and turn right. There is a bus stop right there. Jump on a bus, cross over the Anzac bridge, and get off when the bus reaches George St. There will be a Woolworths on the right hand side of you bus on the corner of George St. George St. is under going some construction for their light rail system, but all the stores are still open. If you walk down past Woolworths you are headed for Chinatown. Darling Harbour is only a ten minute walk from there. Lots of restaurants down in Chinatown. It will be on your right when you walk down George st. When you see Paddy's Market on your right, just after you pass Campbell st., you are there. Chinatown is right across the street from Paddy's. Do all your shopping at Paddy's. There are no high end stores, but just about everything you can think of to bring home for souvenirs. There is a big food court upstairs if you don't want to eat in Chinatown. If when you get off the bus and head the other way down George Street away from Woolworths, you will end up in Circular Quay where you can catch a ferry to Manley beach. The opera house is also down there. There used to be a free bus running up and down George St., but with all the construction it no longer runs. Probably a half hour walk down to the opera house and about fifteen minutes to Paddy's from Woolworths. Just a couple of hints when you get to Sydney. Great city and Gillian has two really nice apartments out in Rozelle if you don't mind taking the bus. Use the opal cards she has provided and just put ten dollars on each one at the newsagent you pass on the way up to Victoria Road. They will give you a balance. The fare into Sydney is around 3 dollars each way. A lot cheaper than a taxi which will be at least 20. Gillian will stop by after you check in and give you some helpful hints and a nice bottle of wine. Read the booklets she has provided on the table and they will give you some insight into Rozelle and the history of the building she is located in. Highly recommended.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Manly Shores Holiday Apartments</value></hotel_name><title><value>Great views,  terrible value for money</value></title><content><value>Apartment 6 - 93 North Steyne   Apartment block and unit are long past a refurb. Dirty old sofa with cigarette burns, rusting clothes rack on the balcony and rusting cooker from circa 1960.  A deep clean is much needed. We were welcomed with a dried substance (we guessed vomit)</value><value> along the base of the mirrored wardrobe, in the back double bedroom. Layers of dust sat upon the plug sockets and cupboard brackets. It doesn't look like the cooker had seen a deep clean since installment. The shower door of the main bathroom was hanging off and we chose to wear thongs in the shower. Given that guests are expected to empty bins (or face a $65 surcharge),  I'm not overly sure what the cleaners are paid to do.  Some positives include proximity to the beach and flagged swimming areas, clean bed sheets and good views.   Not worth it for $1320 for 3 nights. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Manly Shores Holiday Apartments</value></hotel_name><title><value>Beautiful, but poorly maintained</value></title><content><value>We spent 9 days in August in apartment 23, Ocean Royale. The apartment was beautiful; spacious and clean, and of course with stunning views! There were, however, several small problems which I mentioned to the gentleman at reception on our first morning, and which, for the price</value><value> we paid, we expected to be addressed rapidly. Sadly, nothing was done at all!  Here's a quick summary of the issues I raised with him:  - the oven door didn't close,  - the front right gas hob didn't work, - the cutlery drawer was almost broken. We decided not to use it at all, and lifted the cutlery tray out for the duration of our stay. - the cutlery tray was filthy, full of dust and crumbs. We had to wash the whole thing before we could use anything! - the hairdryer had obviously been dropped and was cracked and broken. I didn't dare use it at all. - the curtains in the twin room wouldn't open or close completely, and there was a cord which was dangling between the curtains.... - there were far too few glasses and not enough cutlery, which meant putting the dishwasher on more frequently than necessary. - the bathroom cupboard doors (in the middle bathroom) didn't stay closed. - the internet connection was very weak in the front bedroom. Plus there was noisy renovation work going on downstairs, and the fire alarm was tested in our apartment at 7.45am on the Wednesday morning!! A bit early when you are on holiday....  Certain of the above issues could have been addressed immediately and we were disappointed that no action was taken. It was a pity that the apartment is so badly cared for as the location is just perfect!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Waldorf Drummoyne Serviced Apartments</value></hotel_name><title><value>Shocking </value></title><content><value>We stayed at this property from 6-13 July. Firstly, our apartment was on situated across the road from the official address. We were in Apartment 3. The location of the apartment is great. A few eateries just outside from the apartment. A short drive to suburban malls.   The</value><value> place is nothing like the photos on the website. The apartment is small, not great in layout and the place is not very clean.   The air con/heater was not working at all throughout our stay. This is the middle of winter. The night manager did bring us a portable heater and mentioned that the equipment was recently serviced. But the aircon heater was coated with a thick layer of dirt. I had to clean it with a wet wipe. Was this really serviced?  The kitchen is tiny and very basically equipped. We could not really cook in the apartment. There is no ventilation and would stink up the entire room.   The bathroom is horrid and old. The vanity had missing door knobs. The walls are in need of a fresh coat of paint. The shower stall is small and the sliding door doesn’t close, so water flows out as you shower. The tiny bathroom houses the washing machine ( which didn’t work), and also a sink to wash and rinse the mops. Very odd layout and placing of items.   Don’t use the washing machine. It’s either very old or not really working. The one evening we washed a load of laundry, during the spin cycle, the machine shook so violently and loudly, we thought it was going to explode. The machine actually shook and moved out of its original position by one machine width.   We will never come back.   </value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

It's opposite Wynyard Station and an easy walk to Circular Quay.  The apartment was $170 for the night which isn't bad. As we drove up from Canberra we had to leave the car in a city car park nearby.  The parking was not ideal in an</value><value> extremely tight basement car park. Fortunately it was over a Saturday and Sunday and the parking was $40.  I found out later that you can book a car park further away on Cumberland Street for about $31.  I had phoned the number for the apartments prior to our stay and left a message enquiring about where to park but no-one phoned me back so don't expect a response if you leave voicemail. The apartment was modern, with full kitchen and laundry with washing machine. The bedroom was adequate, but the bed was too soft and felt like a waterbed with two people trying to sleep on it.  We were on the 10th floor but as we were overlooking the street there was lots of street noise at night and I had to use ear plugs to sleep.   The bathroom okay, with decent shower, extra toiletries and more towels in the cupboard at the entry. The check-in was super easy and we were fortunate enough to get early access to our apartment. There's a mini supermarket about 1 min walk away which was super convenient to get breakfast stuff.  Not sure what's open on the weekend in that part of Sydney.

And no wifi.</value></title><content><value>Disappointed with my stay here as Tripadvisor states it has free wifi - however, upon arrival, I was told that the wifi was not working and the closest place would be the bar up the road. If I'd have known in advance I would have not stayed here, as I like to go online the</value><value> moment I wake up and last thing at night (and numerous times in between!). It was inconvenient to not be able to check social media and emails as soon as I woke up. I ended up sitting in the pub up the road for far too long looking for good seats for the concert that I was in town for. The bathroom was also grim. Dirty with a bunch of little flies/midges in the bath round the plug hole. When I first pulled back the shower curtain I was horrified. As an animal lover (even flies), I also didn't want to just turn the shower on and drown them, so it was hard to know what to do! The bathroom floor edges looked particularly dirty and the sink was not very clean. It also had a small blockage so water built up in the sink and took ages to go down. There are 2 other toilets with sinks, although those sinks had no lock on the doors (only on the toilet door, which is separate to the sink), and the door didn't stay shut, so if you wanted to brush your teeth or wipe make-up off in one of the sinks by the toilet it was hard to know whether anyone else might just walk in! One of the sinks (I only went in one of the toilets) had no hot tap, just a gap where it had been removed. The windows were stiff to open/close. The bedroom window was open when I arrived but as it was so noisy outside with the pub drinkers underneath, I chose to close the window, only to then not be able to get it to stay open on its own the next day. The bed itself was nice, and one of the few clean things (along with the towels). The room has an old leather sofa and armchair, but they are so worn you can see some of the inside stuffing through rips. I also looked under the armchair and found someone else's drink glass! The room door creaked every time I opened it. The room was a little dark, but does have a few lights. I didn't try the TV or the coffee/tea at the coffee/tea station. Best thing about the hotel is the location - less than 10mins walk to Central Station. If I go back to Sydney, I would not stay here again. I had high hopes, but sadly, was disappointed.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>The Kirketon Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>See it all from here.</value></title><content><value>What a terrific "launch pad" - close to so much of what there is to see and do in inner-Sydney. A short walk to Kings Cross/Potts Point, and only a few minutes from the likes of Woolloomooloo, Hyde Park, Royal Botanical Gardens and Oxford Street. All of a sudden you might find</value><value> yourself within arm's reach of the Opera House or in the heart of Sydney's CBD. Then of course there's everything in between such as the classic pubs, cafes, beautiful houses and historic buildings.  The hotel is beautifully restored, everything is so clean and it's all in great working order.  Wifi works well, and so does the tv (not something we can always take for granted!).  The staff are friendly &amp; helpful too.  There's not a lot of space in these parts of town, so you're probably best to forget about the car and use your feet to get about - or the easily-accessible public transport options.  The rooms are understandably small, but in my case I had all I needed with a separate walk-in robe and bathroom.  Although the street outside is busy with cars going by so close to the entrance, and with construction taking place directly opposite, it is peacefully quiet inside.  The only noise which may disturb you is the activities of those in the adjacent room - just the other side of the apparently thin walls (eg: taps &amp; running water, heavy feet).</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Sydney Hotel QVB</value></hotel_name><title><value>Comfortable, compact and convenient</value></title><content><value>I enjoyed my stay at Sydney Hotel QVB. I was a lone traveller so the size of the compact room was not an issue. I'd booked a city view room which afforded me a view across the road to the beautiful Queen Victoria Building. My room was on the 4th floor.  The location of the hotel</value><value> is excellent: it is across the road from Town Hall train station (and a Woolworths) and only two stops from Circular Quay. It's also a direct line to both domestic and international airports. It is only a street or two away from Centrepoint, Myer and a Westfield.  The queen-sized bed was really comfortable and cosy, and the pillows were great, too (not the awful feather pillows that offer no support - these were soft yet firm). The bathroom was very compact but again, as a solo traveller, it was fine. The hairdryer cord was quite short, though, which made drying my hair in the mirror a bit tricky. The shower alcove was a good size and had both a raindrop shower head (my favourite) and a handheld one, too.   The mini bar stocked (all free of charge) small milk capsules, juice x 2, bottled water x 2, and a couple of small bottles of soft drink. There were also free small packets of chip-type snacks, sweet biscuits and crispbreads. There were tea, coffee and sugar sachets and an electric kettle.   The wardrobe was a perfect size for a solo traveller. There was a large flat screen TV on the wall which was easy to operate, and a remote to control the room temperature. There was a small desk and chair.  Staff were happy to oblige my simple requests. The hotel is under renovation but this did not impact my stay at all. Apart from the occasional noise of footsteps on the wooden floor in the corridor, and very dull traffic sounds, there was no intrusive noise.   It was a very comfortable stay and I'd definitely stay there again.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

We had a 5am flight Monday morning and I received an email at 10pm the evening before telling me the</value><value> room wasn’t available and if we would like to separate to go in other mixed dorms. Letting me know the day before? I called them to find out why this was the case because in my eyes that’s completely not our fault and so out of order. They didn’t have any rooms left for the four of us and I told them that we did not want to go with random people. They told me that we had to upgrade for an additional $50. I asked to speak with the manager and they said he was in holiday in ‘Thailand’. I asked to speak with someone senior and again no one was available to speak to me. This being because something like this is completely out of our control. It was too late to find somewhere else to stay considering I had booked this a week in advance and already paid in full! Once arriving at the hostel we had not one apology and they made us pay the $50 upgrade, the staff were so rude, the rooms were absolutely freezing and to top it off one room had a TV and the other didn’t. Why are we upgrading both rooms and them not be equipped with the same entertainment.   I didn’t want to have to pay this upgrade for something that was not our fault. The room was available on booking.com but then a day before it’s unavailable. It’s ridiculous and I would like my money back. The hostel refused to give us a refund as they said it was a non refundable booking, this simply shouldn’t be acceptable.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Billabong Gardens</value></hotel_name><title><value>Bizarre place</value></title><content><value>Pretty much the worst hostel I have ever stayed in. I’ve stayed in dozens. It’s very very odd - and people who stay for more than a little while realise all the weird strange behaviour - almost felt like witchcraft - going on in this place. Bullying staff and management,</value><value> actually emotionally abusive. The decent one or two staff members don’t know how to handle the crazy staff.  Staff play mind games with guests, varying between being your best friend and your worst enemy, keeping everyone off kilter and on edge. If you have any sense of vibes, you will immediately pick it up - if you don’t, you’ll figure it out. Lots of weird quiet guests in the shadows, saying really strange things to people, lots of mind games - and the management kick out anyone with no notice or explanation - about 10 people kicked out over the course of 2 weeks for having harmless fun or “not telling, just go - rumours”. Then they struggle to fill the beds, so they have heavily discounted rates. No other hostel I have ever been to engage in such bizarre high school power dynamics. Basically they just let guests sort things out and don’t do endless rumour and innuendo.  Takes a while to figure out, as there are one or two of us groups who have all the fun. The staff get uptight and close up any social outdoor seating and the tv room after about 11 pm. Even if you’re not disturbing anyone. You have to wait till they go home, but they make sure everything is locked up so that no one can actually relax. Then, they go around blacklisting at other hostels anybody who says that they want to check out early, or who they kick out, to try to prevent them from checking in anywhere else, even if they haven’t told them what is supposedly done wrong. That’s how insane they are. Or for minor misdeamnours. The hostels humour them, and then ignore them.  Many guests left early as they felt uncomfortable, several of my mates left, we all went to a hostel elsewhere and relaxed and laughed and felt way better - the other hostels had all heard of Billabong and laughed when we mentioned it, their reputation as the last place to be for travellers precedes them.  Guests are aggressively threatened and rebuked for peacefully congregating one minute, and then sidled up to the next, very strange. Then, they will be smiling and collecting stories on somebody else and threatening them. It’s just a very strange place. Most who say “it’s great!” stay short term before they realise.  All outdoor areas are smoking and staff flaunt the no smoking section of the outdoors, so everybody else does, too, which is great if you are a chain smoker like most of us and sucks if you are not or are tying to give up - absolutely no chance in this place.  Kind of smelly, dark rooms and cramped bathrooms, too, with no privacy or space to put anything. Gendered bathrooms with no transfriendly signage. Not a diverse place at all. Never any soap in dispensers. PS don’t believe the reviews on Hostel World as they are are not independent and reviews can be changed or deleted by the hostel.  Their response will come in hard for as much deflection and excuses and projection that they can because that’s what they do.

Ridiculous!!</value></title><content><value>Firstly I’d like to say I understand that they want to keep the floor clear but recently the cleaners have been coming in to our rooms and unnecessarily and happily throwing our stuff in a plastic bag. I think they enjoy annoying us. Everyone’s stuff just gets mixed up and they</value><value> don’t handle it carefully, people stuff just goes “missing” it’s ridiculous and not fair. Another stupid rule is that your not allowed anything on top of the locker, not even a bottle of water. My tooth brush and tooth paste got mixed in a bin bag with dirty shoes, t-shirts and a mix of items. It’s like the cleaners and the managers of the hostel have no common sense or respect for anyone, let me just remind you we’re paying customers!!!!!! Something needs to change!!!!!! THIS IS FOR YOU ANNA!!!! Only four hobs working in the kitchen, now that’s stupid. The kitchen gets rammed by people around 5-7 and people have to wait up to an hour to use a hob!! The kitchen is small anyway and having only half of the hobs functioning is outrageous!!!!!!!! It’s been near to a month and there’s still been no change!!!

I then had to go rummaging through bin bags to find my items (some of which were very expensive</value><value> and valuable to me!).  My shoes were neatly on the floor next to my bed and t-shirts were neatly hung over my bed, however were took anyway. I find this incredibly ridiculous and frustrating that the hostels policy is to practically steal your items that are deemed untidy. Even now I have items that I can’t find that I assume have been lost this way. Apart from this the hostel was lovely with nice amenities, tv room and good vibes. Everyone was lovely and the hostel organised various social events to meet people. Really enjoyed the location however the cleaners taking my things really was a huge downer and would discourage me from stay here in future.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

I felt like a complete outsider as it was full of longtermers who seemed really</value><value> unwelcoming and some even rude.   There also were no signs to keep stuff off the floor, which I understand should be normal thing, but I didn't realize it also means no shoes on the floor. I lost my other pair of shoes as the staff had 'cleaned' them away. So make sure you keep your shoes on the bed or in the lockers!

There is a lot of building work going on 6 days a week so expect lot's of noise. Tv reception was poor, could not watch it most evenings. A/c struggles when it is warm.

<item><hotel_name><value>Astra Apartments Sydney - Kent Street</value></hotel_name><title><value>Perfect in all aspects</value></title><content><value>We only found these apartments on one site (booking.com) and ended up booking direct. From first call to after departure the service was excellent. We stayed in an apartment in Melbourne run the same way and the service was awful. Astra do it exactly the way it should be done.</value><value> It is basically a residential building and for us, this is a good thing. It's quiet, clean, extremely handy to everything you'll want to do. The perfect location for the convention centre, casino, ferries, city. Being just two blocks from Darling Harbour, you have a safe and easy walk to anywhere, to any ferry, at any time of day or night. Our only gripe was our unit's view was into the back of an office block. My fault: should have asked for the views featured in site photos. The apartment really has everything you need and the managers respond SO quickly if there's any issue (at check in, the manager noticed a minor plumbing issue and the plumber was on site shortly after). If these apartments don't meet your needs, you must be pretty hard to impress. Absolutely perfect.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Astra Apartments Sydney - Kent Street</value></hotel_name><title><value>Comfy, spacious, convenient</value></title><content><value>The apartments are in a secure building that has many residential apartments, and some units available for travelers.  It is close to Darling Harbor, just across the Pyrmount Bridge, so it is just a short walk to Harborside shops, restaurants, attractions like Sea Life and the</value><value> maritime museum, and train stations.  A full range of restaurants, from a fast food court to upscale dining,  are available at Harborside.  Also, there are convenient cafes on Kent Street close to the unit.  We really liked Cafee Amici, which is right next door, and Cozy Cafe, which is half a block away.    When we were there, George Street was under construction for a new train line into the city.  As a result, the monorail was not running and many buses were rerouted.  We walked most places and used the train for attractions that were too far to walk.  Once the construction work is done, the unit will be even more convenient to get around using the train system.    Our unit was clean, spacious and comfortable.  The bed was great, with lots of pillows.  Internet access worked well.  The balcony is cute, but we did not use it much because we were on the 10th floor, and it was a long way down.  We had a great view of the harbor.  The kitchen was well stocked with pots, pans, dishes, utensils, etc.  We appreciated the laundry, as we had been on the road for a month.  We would be happy to stay there again.    The units are rented more by business travelers than tourists.  There is no concierge or tourist information on site.  If you are prepared to be self sufficient, that's fine.  But if you depend on someone on site to recommend restaurants, to orient you on the city map or tell you where to get a cab or the train, you will be frustrated.  The unit would be more attractive for non-business travelers, if there was at least a Sydney map on site.     Also, the unit was surprisingly limited in consumable supplies.  We were staying for an entire week.  The unit had one packet of dishwasher soap and one packet of laundry soap.  We ended up leaving unwashed (but rinsed) dishes, because we did not have any  more dishwasher soap and did not want to buy an entire box for one load.  Also, there was no salt and pepper, and no spare toilet paper.    When you arrive, you must telephone to the office (which is not on site) and a manager comes over to meet you and give you a key.  We received very limited information from the manager.  She did not tell us, for example, that the key ring has a fob that needs to be shown to a sensor in order to get the elevator to operate.  (Maybe most people would know that?  It took us a while to figure it out.)  The building has a gym and swimming pool, which our room key opened, but we did not know they were  there until our last day.  It took us two days to figure out how to run the air conditioner.  A manual was on site, but we did not find it for two days. Overall, these were very minor issues, but it would be really helpful if there was a binder of information about the unit on site.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

It has a nice atmosphere and is quite clean -- both something that is not always the case in similar establishments in Sydney. The food is good and beers reasonably prices (even a bit cheaper than in other places). The service tends to vary</value><value> from good and friendly to unenthusiastic and poor. The bar provides Crowddj-service, which in theory lets customers choose the background music for free. Don't be fooled by this: as we learned, the bartenders can use their program to override any decisions made by customers and play their own favorite music. I think it says something of the place that it nominally provides this opportunity to their paying customers but then at the end keeps misleading them.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

After arriving at the hotel to check in we were met by two rude staff members that clearly had no interest in helping us. One even stopped our check in to take photos on her phone to send to her friends. If this</value><value> wasn't unprofessional enough we were then advised of a $50 "key deposit". This was not mentioned anywhere on their website or in our booking confirmation. When we did eventually get to our room, the door was barricaded with large bags of rubbish. The room was tiny and unclean - small things like no bath mat meant that water leaked out of the shower whenever it was used, there was so sheet on the bed only a doona. The corridor smelt of weed and it was incredibly rowdy at night. The 'security' door was constantly left open which meant any person off the street could've walked into the 'hotel' part of the bar and noone seemed to mind. For the amount of money charged, this hotel is not worth your time and we won't be back any the soon.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

The decor was really cute and the location is great, walking distance to the main shops and beach. Bathroom and kitchen were in immaculate condition and the garden downstairs is lush and very well cared for.  The rooms upstairs</value><value> are all fairly close to each other, and this fact combined with the shared bathroom and kitchen made it feel a bit less intimate than we would have liked. We woke to the sound of people playing tennis next door both mornings which was kind of annoying, too.   David was very welcoming, however there were lots of rules about using the kitchen which left us feeling as if we were intruding in someone's home, rather than guests who were there to relax. We therefore chose to skip using the kitchen.

Our apartment on level 7 had 3 bedrooms, one</value><value> with ensuite and  then another with separate bathroom. The beds were a good size, very comfortable with fresh white bed linen and the spare room we didn't use had two large single beds, great for kids or another couple.  This apartment had a great view and everything for a short or longer stay. The close proximity to everything was the bonus, Coogee to Bondi Coastal Walk, Coogee Bay Hotel for dinner and Sports Bar with AFL on the big screen, a restaurant right below the apartments called SugarCane, well patronised, fresh Asian inspired food, wine list and service to die for. It was my birthday and so out the waiter came with dessert with candle and a chorus of Happy Birthday, a surprise treat.

The</value><value> apartment we were in (704) was very tired, and really needs some work to be at a standard you would expect at the price.  For example, white paint had been lazily slapped on skirting boards, and walls were chipped in various places. Little maintenance taking place.  The lift was jamming consistently (left hand side), and this was concerning us so much we had to use stairwells and avoid lifts (or hope to get the right hand side lift).

There was a lovely view of the beach both from the small balcony and the living room windows.  It was overlooking Kurrawa Street and we were a bit unlucky in that twice in our 4-night stay, the bins were very noisily collected but, otherwise, it was a quiet apartment, particularly in the bedrooms at the back.  There was a free parking space allocated to the apartment but we did not need this.  Would have been five stars except for the draughty windows.  They are the old fashioned metal type and did not close snugly in places meaning we had to have the heating on a little more than we'd have anticipated.  If it was in the UK I would suggest double glazing.  Only visited Reception once, which is not open 24/7, but found them helpful.  I would certainly return to this apartment and at around £230 per night for such a great location, feel it was good value for money.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Easy Go Backpackers</value></hotel_name><title><value>Very bad</value></title><content><value>I don't really know where to begin. My experience was so awful that I ran away not only from the hostel but from Sydney! The hostel is like most of the cheapest accommodation in the city center: dirty, noisy and unprofessional. I was very impressed by the staff, both cleaning</value><value> and reception. Especially two boys, one young German guy at the reception was very unpleasant (probably with no job experience in the area) and another cleaning guy was very rude (he use to knock hard and perpetually while you are having a shower). The first room I had was on George St. (too noisy) so I asked for another room: bad idea! They gave me a ten bed room with three girls from the staff that were living in the hostel, I have never seen a room so messy. There was everything on the floor (took a picture that I'm going to post). The kitchen is so dirty that bugs easily can fall from the ceiling (this really happened to me the first and last time I cooked). The free breakfast is just old bread and jam and don't forget to watch out for that lovely cleaning guy! He can spray your breakfast because he wants to clean the table or put the chairs on the table while you are still seated! Well, I only hope the owner starts taking care of his guests (we are not only simple customers, that's why is called "hospitality") and hiring people more professional. A cheap service doesn't have to be necessarily bad.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Easy Go Backpackers</value></hotel_name><title><value>Good place to stay</value></title><content><value>The first thing that greets you when you enter this establishment is the stench of death incarnate in the hallway and stairs up to the reception, same with the elevator. Smells a tad moldy you might say. Got my room key etc sorted and read over the room rules, no loitering, keep</value><value> a clean and tidy room etc. What meets me when I enter my room, looks like a garbage dump. Two dudes have spread their belongings all over "their" part of the room, and in another corners is a huge pile of garbage, and in the window sill a cup which might have contained alien life. Apparently these guys have not read the room rules.   The room itself though, 6 bed dorm, freaking huge, good beds, fairly cheap to stay there. They got free wifi, can rent movies and watch in the common room with internet computers there as well. The kitchen or laundry facilities I did not check out.  I would probably return to stay here, you kinda get used to the smell, it wasn't present in the room mind you. Just hope you have better luck with your roomies, as well as the staff being better at cleaning up the rooms. Well, two things disappeared from our room after a while, the cup with alien life, don't know if it walked out on its own, and a purse left there from a previous backpacker. All in all, a good stay!

The YHA's, wake up, nomads, base and some others I forget the name of. This hostel charges $27 for 10 bed and $30 for 8 bed, so to start it's a reasonable price for the CBD. The rooms are huge and the beds are comfortable. The</value><value> staff are friendly and the guests who are often long term are nice. The best selling points on this hostel are the free wifi and the good free breakfast. The lounges are comfortable and relaxed and the kitchen is big enough for mosts needs.  The only downsides I could see were the hefty key deposit of $40 but you obviously get that back. And then $10 for cutlery if needed. There aren't many bathrooms, but I was never left waiting, so didn't see a problem.  They have an extensive film collection and ps3 games. You also get a towel for your stay too.

The peace and quiet was so relaxing, but we did go at the end of winter during the week so we were the only ones there. Next time we would bring our own food to make best use of it all. We took a short ferry ride to Woolwich for dinner at the hotel, which included a free glass of wine or beer for mentioning our stay. Staff were friendly and took us by buggy to the apartment which is up several flights of steps. Just be aware that the cafe is fairly basic and closes early ( 3:30-4pm) in the colder months.

From the moment we arrived on the island and met David, we were made to feel welcome and we were given a comprehensive introduction</value><value> to the island. Alison took us up to the apartment in their motorised buggy which was a big relief as we were not looking forward to lugging our cases up the hill - in the rain. She pointed out access points to the high level of the island and the current photographic exhibition.  The apartment has a mixture of the original features of the building - fireplaces, flooring, windows - with modern bathroom fixtures, kitchen and furniture. All the crockery, cutlery and cooking utensils we required were there and there is a gas barbecue on the deck. I ordered the two different breakfast packs and the barbecue pack with chicken kebabs. All three packs were prepared as advertised and with very generous servings.  Alison did a second run up the hill for us with the buggy when we had collected the food packs.  The view across the harbour and down to the bridge is stunning. The nesting seagulls, right outside our apartment and next to the deck, were a positive addition to the ambience and were not problematic to us in any way.

The history of the Island includes ship building industry, convict, girls reformatory.  On the flat part of the island there is an excellent camping ground with regular and "glamping" tents set up, good camp kitchen and showers etc (around $100 a night).

While the units maintain their heritage look, with original fireplaces in the living and bathrooms,  they have gas</value><value> barbeques on the decks with the spectacular views, dishwashers, microwaves and washing machines.   During the day, there is a ferry every half hour to/from Darling Harbor. Other ferries take half an hour to Circular Quay. Upriver ferries take you towards Parramatta. Staircases take you down to/from the ferry terminal very quickly. Barbeques were brand new for our visit.  Dishwasher in 23A has become finicky and probably needs replacing.  But the one in 23B worked perfectly.    Seagulls had started nesting at end August, but weren't a serious problem in 23A/B, which have fishing line strung from the roof to the ground to discourage them.  Might be an issue in the garden apartment (23C) during the nesting season.     Lots to see on the island with astounding historical sights from both the penal and the dockyard eras.   No wifi available during our stay.  Creating our own hotspot with a Vodaphone 4G card solved the problem.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

At no fault of my own our booking was cancelled on us. Sandy Bottoms Guesthouse then expected us to stay once I explained the card details, however my partner and I were dissatisfied and cancelled our booking anyway. I then experienced an extremely unprofessional phone call resulting in Sandy Bottoms Guesthouse hanging up on me, not once but twice. It then became very hard for my partner to get in contact with Sandy Bottoms Guesthouse.

Staff is super rude and not interested in having you as a pleased guest but treat you very badly! They clean and vacuum all the time even at 6am and at midnight! Doors and walls are super thin and people especially all the long-term</value><value> people that live here are loud til after midnight and don’t care about people trying to sleep! Breakfast is served only 2 hours 8-10 and 9-11 on weekends but is good. WORST PART is they take away your stuff without you knowing if you put anything on the floor like even your backpack or shoes! They’ll put in in big black bags and bring it downstairs just leaving a note at your door that your stuff has been removed! They took my shampoo out of our en-suite shower as well after I went out of the room for 5 minutes and did never tell me! Don’t stay here at all there are better hostels for the same budget!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Ady's Place Backpackers</value></hotel_name><title><value>Don't stay here if you are a solo backpacker!</value></title><content><value>There are many long-term residents which gives the hostel a very cliquey atmosphere, and some residents are naturally rude and unwelcoming.  Some people are quite welcoming but most of the time you feel uncomfortable when doing the simplest of things in the hostel, i.e. cooking.</value><value>   At peak hours it is impossible to try and cook food as there are so many people trying to cook in such a cramped area!  A good thing about the hostel however is that the staff do a decent job in keeping it clean.  If you are a solo backpacker like myself who only wants short term residence, please pay a bit more money to stay at a better hostel. You will regret it otherwise!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

The room was spacious, clean &amp; comfortable with an en-suite shower and sink. The only negatives was you almost always got a cold shower unless you woke up at the crack of dawn and the room doesn’t have any air conditioning</value><value> so it gets a lil sweaty on the summer days (plenty of windows though). As a backpacker, this hostel is great for making friends, they have event managers who organise things for you to do all day. I especially enjoyed our trip to the blue mountains (thanks jack). The kitchen &amp; dining area is a bit small but manageable and the TV room is sociable. I did find it a little strange that there was only 2 toilet cubicles on each floor and 2 showers, if I didn’t have one in the room I could imagine this would be a nightmare.

I also received an electric shock from a free standing light stand which had no light bulb in the shade!

Don’t recommend!</value></title><content><value>Despite all the good reviews online for this hostel we did not have the same experience as the majority of previous guests. Upon arrival, we were greeted and checked in by a very pleasant receptionist who we recall was the manager. From that point onward, things went downhill.</value><value> It was a run down, dirty, unpleasant and sauna like hostel with literally no ventilation besides a 1850’s semi functional fan in each room which made the noise of a small plane. Long story short, we were accused by a incompetent, unprofessional staff member of throwing a plank of wood out of our window at other guests staying in the hostel. When she realized it had nothing to do with us and discovered it was an accidental incident by other hostel guests in the room above us we failed to receive any form of apology. For a basic backpacker hostel Ady’s place is extremely overpriced and lacks basic cleanliness and amenities. Our experience was extremely disappointing and not worth the unreasonable expense. As a group of 4 guests who have stayed in various hostels both in Australia and overseas we would not recommend this place to anyone. Avoid at all costs!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Asylum Sydney Backpackers Hostel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Locally located, worndown dark hostel with friendly helpful staff.</value></title><content><value>I had booked this hostel judging by the high number on hostelworld. I think there is might be a lot of difference between the rooms which, according to the staff, are renovated one by one.  I stayed in a six-person dormitory and was "upgraded" to a room with ensuite bathroom. It</value><value> felt damp during the entire stay despite the fact that there was an air conditioning on. There was also a stale sour smell that might have been drawn into the very grubby carpet. In addition to a large locker, there were no cupboards or surfaces to store items so that the guests' belongings were located throughout the room.  Pros are - Centrally situated. Only 18 minutes walk from Hyde Park and 2 minutes to Supermarket and Metro. - a modest complimentary breakfast (white bread / jam / milk and cerials) - Very friendly staff. - Fridge with freezer in the room.  Negatives: - A portion of the courtyard garden is also used as a recycling center for the neighborhood. This makes the stay in the outside area unpleasant because of the view, noise from the deposit and the stench of the recyclable waste. The entire hostel is dark and old and worn. The common room is in the basement and has hardly any daylight. - Air conditioning has no noticeable effect on temperature or air humidity in the room.-  -Pricey ($35 pppn) compared to the surrounding hostels with better or equivalent facilities. -Low water pressure in the worn bathrooms with lots of mold between the cracked joints.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

I booked a "basic 6-bed dorm" on Hostelworld, incorrectly thinking it would look like the other nice</value><value> pictures of the rooms. It was the cheapest bed in a decent hostel showing on search results, so I thought, what the heck - I'll take it. The room happened to be ok with its own fridge, air-conditioning, lockers and wash basin, but was not so pretty - quite dim with only a tiny window (picture a large-ish basement converted into a cozy bedroom). Fair enough, I made an assumption and paid the price. The slightly more expensive dorms upstairs are a lot better - I got put into a six bed dorm, this one has so much more space and actually looks like the pictures on the website! Bathrooms and kitchen are cleaned regularly but look like they could use a little renovation. From what the managers told me, they are working on this - I wish them good luck.

Small woolworths food</value><value> market and a Coles supermarket available nearby walking distance. The apartment is fabulous!!! We stayed in the 3 bedroom penthouse with beautiful views, very spacious, very well furnished and equipped. Just like in the website's pictures, they are all true. Find the description directly on their website.  Apartment is equipped with a full laundry wich allowed us to travel light knowing we would be able to wash clothes, and washing soap is even included. The kitchen is completely equipped as well, with anything you need from dishes, pans, pots, cutlery, glasses, fridge, stove, oven, tea kettle, etc. You even get a microwave and a bread toaster. You don't have to buy anything for your stay as the property includes dishwashing soap, paper/cloth towels, tea bags, coffee, etc.  The apartment is impecable. Everything in top maintenance and working conditions (surface finishes, applicances, bathrooms, lighting, carpets, etc). Beds and pillows super comfortable, they really help you sleep well.  You won't find any stains, funny or bad odours, and the best of all...no noise!! It´s really quiet, windows block outside noise very effectively, and even the air conditioning/heating system is reeeeeaalllly quiet. About temperature, we could very effectively control it to our needs. Although all communication is digital (no personal contact) the manager Suzanne Wood was really helpful and kind to me, solving all my issues. I'm glad I chose this hotel for our 12-nights long stay.

<item><hotel_name><value>MyHoYoHo Apartments Haymarket</value></hotel_name><title><value>Service was lacking</value></title><content><value>I stayed at one of their apartments in Pyrmont.  The location was great for what I was doing (Doltone House near the Star).  The kitchen was pretty well stocked, and the apartment was what I expected for the price (it was very reasonable).   However - the check-in process what</value><value> horrible.  I arranged a specific time (in their window of time which was small) and waited outside the door.  When I finally called them, they sent out a cleaner who was to show me to to my reserved apartment - number 4.  She got all confused and took me to 4 - which had someone in it.  Then we discovered I’d been changed to 8 and no one had informed me.  She took me upstairs and cleaned something else while I’m a standing here to check in.  Then she wanted to take a photo of my credit card - front and back!  Yeah, right?  Sure - so they can buy or purchase anything they like on line...... Nutters process.  I told her no- she called me later and said she would come at 10 o’clock at night to get my credit card details...I told her I’d be asleep then.....Later I called the office and gave them info over the phone to process a deposit - but that was nuts.  Very unprofessional and our information should be handled in a more secure way.  The apartment was not very clean - dust everywhere and a doona of questionable cleanliness with no top sheet - so who knows what or who else I was sharing my bed with.

There are many excellent restaurants within a couple of blocks and the wonderful Apollo greek restaurant actually provides room service at this hotel. However the Hotel itself</value><value> is very basic. Reception staff are not particularly helpful and the rooms while adequate are very  basic and drab.Disabled access is problematic as there are narrow corridors and steps everywhere and th lifts are ancient.  However the feature that is a complete disaster is the internet access . If it works at all it is unbelievably slow. It keeps dropping out, the sign in process is tedious and in the end you just give up. I keep reading about places that boast the opportunity for a "digital detox" well here is a hotel that offers internet blackout and it's right in the heart of Sydney. Dont bother with the breakfast here either. It is less than basic and there are some very good cafes serving excellent breakfast and coffee in the immediate vicinity.

I don't expect a lot and I have stayed in some dives in the past. Although very dated, it was clean and pleasant and the bed was comfy. The window couldn't be opened at all and</value><value> was frosted out, so there was no natural light getting in the room, but as I spent about 10 mins awake in there, it didn't bother me at all.

Check in was fine, however as soon as we were told what room number we were, you could tell by the</value><value> look on the receptionist face... it wasn’t a great room. I got the feeling she felt for us while handing over the key.   Off we trot to our room, which was at the very back of the hotel. After an interesting trip in the lift, up some stairs, down a corridor down 2 flights of stairs, we arrived at our room... the pictures speak for themselves.   We could not have been given a worse room in my opinion.   Phoned reception to find out the hotel was full and we would need to call back in the morning to see if any more availability. We were not willing to stay here, not when we wanted to enjoy our time in Sydney.   If you’re booking as part of a package, do yourself a favour and upgrade your hotel, this was our fault, and this rating reflects the room.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Space Q Capsule Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Okay place near CBD</value></title><content><value>Nice location close to the Central Opal station and the CBD. Plenty of restaurants, pubs, shopping and activities in the area. Staff was young and very indifferent, they did their job but were not engaging in any way.  The pod itself was unique and adequate, although the AC/fan</value><value> was terrible so the unit does get rather hot at night.  Also, the USB charging port inside of the pod barely worked so could not get a full charge on a phone even after 6-7 hours.  The pods do block out any noise, so can be noisy, depending on the courtesy of your neighbors.  The mattress was just a 2" pad, nothing plush but not uncomfortable either.  The pod offered a small safe for extra security of cash, passport, and other small items.  A luggage locker was also provided, measuring about 14"x14"x34".  The locker was sufficient to store a basic backpack or other medium-sized soft luggage.  As others have noted, the bathrooms are small!!  The hostel is located on the upper floors of the building.  While there is an elevator, it seemed slow and potentially unreliable.  On the plus side, the WiFi was strong and reliable and there was plenty of hot water.   All in all, not a bad place to stay as the location was convenient and it was reasonably-priced.  But there are other options equally convenient that are priced better.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Space Q Capsule Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Good hostel alternative for introverts</value></title><content><value>This is a great novelty hotel. Well, more a hostel than a hotel, actually. The name is misleading. The entrance is cool in that it's just a long corridor leading to a heritage elevator, with a bit of mystery feel. The capsule itself is surprisingly convenient and comfortable</value><value> (comparing to a hotel stay), and all of your important stuff is actually nearby in the pod with you. I did not feel claustrophobic at all, even with the capsule sealed.   The kitchen area is spacious and clean, and laid out in a convenient way that even someone who isn't a backpacking teenager who doesn't normally cook, would actually want to use it. The chill out space is a separated space adjoining it, making the kitchen area more quiet and comfortable. That said, the location is extremely convenient, so even if you were to eat out, you easily could.  Where this hotel fell short for me, is everything else. For starters, although I booked a room in the girls' dorm, they somehow 'ran out' and put me in the men's dorm. This is not that terrible considering the pods are enclosed. That said, it's not my preference, and more importantly, the bathrooms are then on the wrong floor. Every time I had to go to the bathroom or shower, I have to climb up the stairs.   To make this worse, the showers are extremely small, except for the end ones. How small? There's just enough space for you to stand in it, and turn around - and that's about it. To emphasise, I am a tiny, slender, 5 foot Asian, and even I would wait for the end showers to become free. There are no ledges or hooks to put your bath things on while you shower, which means you probably have to dump them in the tiny corner sink. It's possible to drape your towel over the door and have it stay dry, but your change of clothes would have to be hung outside. The place clearly sliced up a too-small space into too many showers, to comply with some kind of planning regulations 'on paper'.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

On the dining table was a booklet with customer info, such as check out times, room/fee's conditions/rules and the free UNLIMITED wifi password - free wifi is always very much appreciated as it is such a necessity in today's society.

<item><hotel_name><value>The English Lodge</value></hotel_name><title><value>Great half-way house</value></title><content><value>Stayed here for a total of about 6 months with my partner whilst working in Sydney to save for our travels. It's in a good location, about 15 minutes from the city centre by train. Some local shops for fresh fruit and veg. Couple of pubs close by. About 20 minutes walk to the</value><value> nearest super market, but if you're travelling out from the city it's best to shop before you get on the train as it's just a 5 minute walk from the station.  Considering that it's roughly $300 pp pw to stay in a hostel with all shared facilities, staying here chopped our costs in half with a private room with en-suite. The kitchen is cleaned daily, but it's your responsibility to clean your own utensils.  Basic utensils are provided. But not all are in great condition. You have your own cupboard in the kitchen to store these and food. The kitchen is hardly ever busy (maybe 2 or 3 times during our total stay), so you don't have to fight for space and cooking appliances as you do in hostels. Note that this is a mixed environment, much more like an apartment block than a hostel, so don't expect lots of social events! The rooms are decent enough size if you're travelling and not carrying a house full of belongings with you. The rooms have ac, fridge-freezer, sink/cupboard, TV and pc (although outdated). The management are great and will help you out with any queries if you're new to Sydney. They're also kind enough to deliver parcels to your room (depending on size) when it's delivered to the office address.  So if you want out of hostels and don't want the long term commitment of private rental, this is a good alternative. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>The English Lodge</value></hotel_name><title><value>Cheapest lodge in Sydney, but you get what you pay for</value></title><content><value>Location is not bad. It's across from a strip club and close to city bus routes and the train station.  The room rates can't be beat. Ensuite double for less than $300/week, you can't find anything cheaper than that in Sydney, I guarantee it. With free internet, A/C, laundry,</value><value> and secure parking!  But.... yeah, there's a reason for the cheap price. This place is depressing as hell.   Our room felt like a dark prison cell. The window was blocked by an oddly-placed wall partition. The bed was a bunk above a couch, with a dresser on the other side. There was barely enough room to turn around.   We had an ensuite. The bathroom was small, but functional. I am not sure if the rooms get cleaned between guests. The sheets/bedding certainly were not changed, as they were dirty and smelled like BO when we arrived. The bed is a thin foam mattress.  Okay, here's the worst part -- The minimum stay is 4 weeks. I can understand living in a prison cell for a few days if you're on the go, but if you are going to stay in Sydney for at least a month, surely you can find a cheap sublet or shared accommodation. I wouldn't stay here again unless I was absolutely flat broke and committing suicide was not an option.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>The English Lodge</value></hotel_name><title><value>Only good if you meet certain criteria.</value></title><content><value>I am staying here for 4 weeks. With my mum so we got a room with own toilet for $295 per week. Good value for temporary but needs to be longer than 2 weeks. Upon arrival. We were quite dissapointed. There's no where to hang our clothes. So, it's bad if you need long term stay.</value><value> The admin staff does the cleaning which is weird. They had 'linen' which looks like old linen from Salvos. or something. So good to have your own linen or you need to rewash them. Good that you can do laundry for free. They have different types of furniture, which seems like they got it donated from somewhere and just tried to put the room together. The whole place is dusty, they don't have proper people to clean the place. Aircon works but is super dusty so is the exhaust fan in the shower. Best to reclean the entire room and toilet again. Own fridge in the room is good. The utensils provided also looks donated or bought from salvos. This is a strange place. Overall not a bad place for value. Coles is a litle far. Could do better.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>The English Lodge</value></hotel_name><title><value>Great location and good price</value></title><content><value>I stayed here during my transition into Sydney. They have rooms with attached bathrooms and rooms without.  In addition to the rooms they had a shared laundry and a shared large kitchen with 4 stoves - plenty for everyone. Plus: The room that I stayed in had a fridge, TV,</value><value> microwave, AC, bunk beds, table, small sink.  It was cosy and I can't complain for the price.  You were responsible for cleaning out the rooms and the laundry of the sheets. Each room got its own cupboard in the kitchen which cotained kitchen utensils.You were free to cook till anytime that you wanted to. They had plates, cups, pans, etc..  The cooking stuff of course had to be provided by yourself.  The kitchen was cleaned on a regular basis. Location wise it was just a 5 minute walk to the train station - so very convienient to get around. Groceries could be bought from a shop closeby as well. The sleep quality was good considering that it was right next to the main road - you didn't hear much from inside the room.  Negatives: Toilet: This wasn't cleaned on a daily basis and if you are one of those people who expect a spic toilet each and every time you visit then this isn't the place for you - unless you get one of the rooms with the ensuite bathrooms.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Peninsula Holiday Apartments Manly</value></hotel_name><title><value>Fabulous accommodation in a stunning location. Wow!</value></title><content><value>We stayed in Peninsula Apartment 7, which is one of a block of self- catering apartments within walking distance of the hotel.  Having holidayed in the UK for a number of years we've stayed in alot of places and this is by far the most luxurious, spacious and beautifully</value><value> equipped apartment we've stayed in with the added bonus of glorious views over Porthminster beach.  We arrived at the hotel to check-in and a valet parked the car in its dedicated space for us.  Parking in St. Ives is at a real premium so to have a space of our own was a real plus, although we weren't going to spend a lot of time in the car whilst on holiday.  Having checked in we were shown to our apartment.  The apartment had a very high specification, was very spacious with a large open plan lounge/ dining area/ kitchen.  This had full width patio doors opening on to a balcony which overlooked the beach which was a short walk away.  We like our gadgets and were pleased to see the apartment had its own wifi and large TV to keep us amused just in case it rained (which it didn't much that week at all).  The main bedroom was next door to the living area and shared the same balcony.  This was lovely as we could leave the doors open and listen to the sea gently lapping against the shore.  The main bedroom had an ensuite bathroom with a bath/shower which had plenty of heat and power.  The second bedroom was at the rear of the property and like the main bedroom benefitted from its own TV.    The kitchen had all the facilities you'd want for cooking and having a good time.  We booked the apartment through the Cornish Gems website and this allowed us to pre-order food before our trip and request to have it delivered.  It arrived at 6PM and we were able to enjoy the lovely fresh meat and veg prepared and cooked in the kitchen.  As the apartments were part of the hotel complex we had full use of the hotel and spa facilities throughout our stay.  The spa was superb.  We'd typically go around 6PM when it was quiet and had almost exclusive use of the pool, steam room and sauna.  There was also a gym (which I didn't use!) which had loads of exercise parafanalia with beautiful views to admire whilst working out.  We dined at the hotel one evening and the service and food were both first class.  The restaurant has spectacular views and the tables are large and well presented.  The menu provided great choice of locally grown food served in a contemporary and professional way.  The hotel also had a terrace bar which on the many of the sunny days we enjoyed provided a welcoming outside experiencing drinking and eating and whiling away the hours.  Under the terrace bar was open air chill-out area, protected from the rain by the terrace above and furnished with sofas, cushions and to provide a relaxing, outdoors and dry experience.  We spent a week at the apartments and all-in-all had a wonderful time.  The hotel and grounds were fabulous and when we wanted to we could walk down the footpath to the beach and enjoy a walk on the golden sands.  The beach includes a couple of bars and beach restaurants serving very good food... and delicious chips.  Upon leaving the valet collected our car and helped with packing.   It was the end of a fantastic week and we hope to return sometime soon.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

This involved a casual meal and drink meeting over a video screening that we provided the equipment for. It was a daytime activity</value><value> in the bright and airy upstairs function room, and pre-booked with their events manager for over a month.   On arrival, we were greeted with blank looks from the staff who appeared uninformed of the function which was to take place between 2-6pm.  The attitude of the staff on realising that it was actually a double-booking overlapping with another event starting at 5pm was to treat our organiser with what was overtly aggressive and rude behaviour, refusing to acknowledge their mistake (even on showing the email event confirmation).  Instead, the weekend duty manager called their events manager who only works Monday to Friday an "idiot".    Staff openly made poor comments about the event loudly in regards to our attendance in the downstairs bar in front of guests, and when the other party showed up at 5pm as we were winding up our event early, it was clear that they had blamed us for the room not being available and clean as I'm sure they had expected.  This other party also carried on the attitude towards us and were clearly informed to blame us.    Our event cleared out prior to the booking time at 5.15pm, but despite this, no indication was given that they were appreciative of our efforts to finish early. Given the outward rudeness and clear communication issues of their own hotel, I could not recommend the venue.  Our organisation will not be returning, and will be making the same complaint directly to the venue.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

Yesterday was different, as I was hungry and thirsty and there was a proper menu. So I felt it worthy of writing a review.   Haven't had bangers 'n mash for a while. I</value><value> expected a hardy pub type meal, you know, a few sausages and a generous serving of mashed potato with plenty of gravy.   I was wrong.   The whole meal could have fitted on a piece of toast. The sausage was cut in half to make it cook faster or appear like you were getting more. It sat on top of a small helping of potato, with a tiny amount of fried onion and gravy.   I was still hungry so I went to Woolworths on the way back to my hotel and bought some snacks.   The meal itself was tasty, and about half way between an entree and 'normal' pub sized banger 'n mash dish I'm used to and expect. Even if they'd scrimped on the meat component I'd at least expect, as potato and gravy is cheap, that the plate would be of decent proportions. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Bridal Falls Cottage</value></hotel_name><title><value>Lovely Cottage House</value></title><content><value>It was like living in a secret garden somewhere in Leura. And the host was very attentive to make sure you have the best stay ever. Well stocked fridge, kitchen facilities and utensils, we enjoyed cooking our hearty breakfast and dinner supplemented by groceries from Coles a</value><value> short pleasant drive away. Misty morning made our breakfast time magical. Basked in white gentle sunlight, caressed by the pleasant warmth of the fireplace that fought the heavenly cold mountain air trying to get inside when we opened the door. The garden view though the large French windows, the hot bacon on our plates we ate. The stay did not give a commercial feel like those common in hotels or motels. It was quite and secluded. It felt like home away from home. There’s a living room, a separate bed room, and the bathroom with a spa. Warm dip massaged by water jets in cool autumn, it was awesome. BBQ facilities was available, but too bad it rained and so we had no chance to enjoy an outdoor BBQ dinner. There was a washing machine and a dryer. The cottage was truly self-contained. That’s said, we truly enjoyed our cozy idyllic and tranquil short stay. Truly family friendly, lovely every bit.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Sydney Star Backpackers</value></hotel_name><title><value>Nice and quiet</value></title><content><value>This hostel wasn't too far from the main attractions. Had clear instructions all around.   Reception when on duty was very nice and smiley. If had any enquires before hand by email was always quite a quick response :)  The kitchen area is small but was ok. Free bread, butter,</value><value> jam, cereal and milk, tea, coffee.  There was loads of things cooking facilities to make up something yourself.  The room was a nice size. A dorm of 4 (female) Comfy beds. There was a locker under the bed which is slightly akward to get to and only 2 power stations, one next to someone eles bed and another near the coat rack.  There was a sink in the corner which was handy but was quiet dusty and also on the frame of the beds.   Bathroom / toilet was mostly clean. Plently of toilet tissue. New shower which always had hot water which was a amazing and had a modern fresh look.  Again the sink needs a good clean around it was dust.  There is only 4 showers around so in the morning if your in a rush make sure you add some time on.  Wi-Fi was great. Did not go up to the terrace so can not say much on that.   Overall was nice, good people, wasn't full of the usual crazy young packers. Im 28 and past the time of partying all night. Was able to sleep with no nosie. Was good enough for the price just the odd small things that drops my rating.  Thanks for the stay. Also love Sydney!!! </value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Sydney Star Backpackers</value></hotel_name><title><value>Tolerable for the good location</value></title><content><value>The dorm room is quite a bit more cramped than hostels I've been to before, although for all I know this is normal for Australia. It's not just the square footage either; the way the room is laid out means that you and your stuff are spread across the whole space (towel,</value><value> charging ports, locker, window ledges etc.) and that bags would occupy a lot of floor space (lower bunk too low to have most bags fit underneath), making the place feel more cramped than it needed to be. So, my actual time in the room was not restful. The showers were good, though, and the wait time was not too long.   As I mostly ate out with my local friends (the reason why I chose to have a long transit in Sydney in the first place), I did not utilise the kitchen much. It seemed ok, albeit not too organised or warm in layout.   I might have had a better experience if I had taken a private room instead. Since this hostel is rated highly by other travellers, perhaps this is a normal stay experience for Australian hostels - so, something for more introverted travellers to take into consideration.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Metro Apartments on King</value></hotel_name><title><value>Location saves it.</value></title><content><value>Location of this property is excellent for access to Darling harbour that's about where the good stops unfortunately.  We stayed for 10 days and I dont think we slept much the whole time. We were located on the first floor and the street  noise is horrendous! Double glazed</value><value> windows may help there! The walls are so thin you can hear the conversations in the next apartment.  For a long term stay one would have expected to maybe get a better deal? The room is in dire need of a revamp, things were broken in the room and cleanliness was only just bearable.   Our bed was changed once during our stay which is fine but they never changed the foldout bed which was being used also. The shampoo, body wash etc ran out within the first day or two and was never checked to top up.  Often the coffee was not topped up either. They only vacuumed once during our stay and that was a day before we left so needless to say the floor was messy but room attendants just left it.   The  roof top pool is good but only went once as you have to walk the last 3 flights of stairs as the elevator does not go to the top so some of our group were elder.  Overall I would stay again because it is a 2 minute walk to Darling harbour but the price is similar to others in the area of better quality lodgings.  The photos on the booking sight must be elsewhere as our room was definitely not that nice. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Glebe Village Backpackers</value></hotel_name><title><value>Don't stay here if you like to eat food and use the internet.</value></title><content><value>The first thing that met me was a receptionist that kept interrupting me while I was speaking. He made me wait while he attended other guests. After a while I understood that he just had to be blunt with the customers because of the amount of weird requests people kept coming up</value><value> with. Expect a weird crowd when you are only staying for the cheap price. I was booked in a 12-bed dorm, so I didn't expect much. Still, I was disappointed when there was no place for my bag. They have chests under the bed for each person, but I didn't get one because my bed was in a corner with another bed. Ended up storing my bag by someone elses bed, and sleeping with my backpack in the squeaky bed with me. The kitchen and common areas closes at 9 pm. After that you are not allowed to get your food. You are not allowed to eat in the rooms either. So when I asked where I was supposed to eat my evening meal, one of the staff just shrugged his shoulders and told me to organize my day better. The wifi sucks, and even my phone data gets a bad signal at that place. So be prepared to be sent to bed with no internet at 9 pm. The kitchen is really hot and crowded. They have gas ovens and bad air circulation. Almost got a heat stroke from trying to cook a decent meal. Plus, it is basically outside with the door open all day, so there is a bunch of cockroaches in there. I also smelled weed there every day I was there. I don't mind it, however it just made the other rules look so silly. You can smoke weed all day, but not cook after 9 pm? The rooms have aircon and my sheets were clean when I got there. I was planning to stay for a few weeks, but ended up switching places because of the whole kitchen situation.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Glebe Village Backpackers</value></hotel_name><title><value>Unfriendly</value></title><content><value>Room has aircon, which is absolutely amazing! That is the only positive thing about this place. kitchen is located in a separate building with wide open doors, so roaches and bugs flourish in the kitchen, literally everywhere. The kitchen is also extremely underequipped, I've</value><value> been here for a month and still have never seen a fork, a cup or a glass. sometimes there are knives. If you don't buy a special fridge bag they'll toss all your food.   The staff is really passive-aggressive, there is no inside area and both the kitchen and the outside area close at 9 pm, but they usually start angrily telling you to go away at 8:30 ish. If you want to eat after nine you have to go out, and you're not allowed to use the outside seating at all after nine. Numerous times I encountered people who arranged to check-in after hours with the reception, they often just don't show so people have to go somewhere else for the night, they don't seem to care at all about their customers. Oh and there are obviously no events or activities.  The wifi is unusable, you can't even bring up a newspage, tried using my phone data - no reception. not backpacker-exclusive so you will have pensioners being yelled at to finish their food at 8:45, noisy nineteen year olds yelling and smoking weed and sometimes children running around all at the same time. Beds are hard and dirty, not enough storage boxes pr. room. laundry has two machines for like fifty people, showers often does not have warm water. Dryers doesn't work, the program runs but it seems it just tosses your clothes around.  Spend the extra 3 bucks a night and go to the YHA, I thought I had low enough standards to cope, but this place is just really bad, all the small things just pile up and annoy you...</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

Access to the lower rooms at the hostel (where I stayed) was</value><value> either down dark side steps or out the back of the kitchen and down wooden stairs, neither are idea in the dark. The rooms are ok and clean enough, ceiling fans work relatively well to keep the room cool, no air conditioning. There aren’t any locker facilities for keeping goods safe and the top bunk beds don’t have rails so you sleep with a fear of falling out! Hallway areas clean and tidy, great bonus to have a washing line to be able to hang clothes on to dry!  Bathrooms aren’t great, in the girls bathroom only one bathroom door locked, every time someone had a shower the floor in the whole bathroom was soaking! Also nowhere to hang your stuff when in the shower to keep it dry! Tiling and general condition of bathrooms poor, could do with a deep clean.  Staff really friendly and helpful and do work hard!

Det stod att vi kunde göra betalningen på plats när vi anlände till hotellet. Allt kändes superbra och gick väldigt smidigt</value><value> med bokningen! Jag får sedan ett mail från Pamela Bond som jobbar på Gunyah House Apartments att de har ett minimum på 7 nätter över nyår och undrade om vi var intresserade att stanna en vecka istället. Vi gjorde om i vår planering och jag skrev att vi gärna ville bo där en vecka istället, eftersom det är svårt och dyrt att hitta andra boenden i Sydney över nyår. Det jag fick som svar av henne då var: "Sorry But I have had another confirmed booking come in for Gunyah House Apartments for New Year’s and they have confirmed with deposit, you have plenty of time to find another place good luck."   För det första stod det INGENTING om att det var 7-nätters minimum på hemsidan när vi bokade, för det andra stod det att betalning på plats var ok och för det tredje HUR kan det ens få gå till på det här sättet?! HUR kan man avboka någon annans bokning utan tillåtelse!? Och sist men inte minst: Hur uppkäftigt är det inte att få höra "you have plenty of time to find another place" - det är nyår i Sydney, vilket betyder att det är supersvårt att hitta boenden för rimliga pengar. Nä, jag rekommenderar INGEN att bo på detta ställe och gynna INTE Pamela. Den värsta servicen jag varit med om i hela mitt liv! Helt oacceptabelt beteende! Har givetvis svarat på hennes mail men såklart har jag inte fått något svar tillbaks från henne. Har även mailat booking.com men inte fått något svar från dom heller.

My partner even tried to clean the wardrobe with some washing up liquid and a tea towel but even the strong smell of lemon could not get rid of the smell so we had to live from our suitcase.</value><value> There was mould in the shower and bathroom area. We even had to wash the cups to get rid of the odour before we had a cup of tea. Shouldn’t really be asking people to pay those sorts of prices for what you get. We stayed in various spots from Canberra all the way up to the Gold Coast, some of which were camping sites and these were better and cleaner/ cheaper than this establishment. It is unfortunate that I can not rave about this place. The best thing was that it was close to the beach and watching the sunrise was beautiful. There was free WiFi but it wasn’t very good. Just to clarify we had a room that was ground floor right by the stairs. The balcony rooms looked as though they had been refurbished.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

Our room was comfortable and clean; the aircon was a very loud ancient unit. The bed was comfortable.The main issues with this place were disorganisation and poor communication.  We were charged $30 for a late</value><value> checkout. Fair enough, but they didnt tell us there was a fee for it, just saying yes we could have it. When I queried it I was told it was for parking, but I had been told that parking was $15 and had declined it. They didnt answer my emails and so I had to ring, so it shouldnt have been confused. It really was a case of the left hand didnt know what the right hand was doing. Make sure you are clear with them about these charges that they dont tell you about and then debit from your credit card.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

These apartments are a great choice.  I did a lot of googling before I booked and these apartments offered great accommodation at a reasonable price.  Norwest might seem out of the way but is actually very close to Castle</value><value> Hill, Pennant Hills etc.  I booked a 3 bedroom apartment which also has 2 bathrooms and a separate laundry. We were on the ground floor which also had a lovely terrace.  Two of the bedrooms were very big with heaps of wardrobe space but the third was small with no wardrobe- I think it was actually a study with a bed.  The kitchen was small but well equipped with everything you need and was perfect for our needs.  There is a small dining area which leads onto the lounge area with a large tv and plenty of seating.  The master bedroom also had a tv.  There was an air conditioning unit in the kitchen/family area and also master bedroom. It was pretty hot while we were in Sydney so aircon in the other two bedrooms would have been good.  There is parking in the basement which was access easily from a lift outside our apartment.  Close by is Norwest shopping centre with a large Coles supermarket along with specialty shops. There is also several restaurants and fast food options.  The Hillsong Church is also located very close by.  There is a new train station being built which should be ready at the end of 2019. This will make getting into the city a cheaper option than the toll roads.  We really enjoyed our stay.  </value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

Threadbare towels, old soaps from other guests left in the bathroom, no amenities at all, uncomfortable beds but worst of all the rooms smell. On one occasion we were woken up by the machinery starting for the day in the MLC centre, on another by the smell of old oil which must somehow come through the MLC air conditioning ducts. The reception service is surly, you don't even get any reception service if you arrive after 4.30pm, and the breakfast which is included is inedible.

I don’t mind an older establishment, but this place needs not only updating but a thorough cleaning. We had the King Superior Room, which included a private balcony which was an accident waiting to happen, overlooking a 6 lane highway</value><value> that never stopped (not the sweeping park view as promised). From the moment you entered the hotel, you can smell a strong musty scent throughout the hotel and room. I thought the attendant was kidding when he said they charge $5.00 per movie from their ancient movie collection, but then I got in to the room to find they also charge you for the use of their room safe. In the past I’ve never changed rooms on a business trip or vacation, but I couldn’t stay there and insisted they look into not charging me the cancellation fee. They charged me a fraction, which was OK with me, I just wanted OUT. We only stayed the night, only because I already paid and to secure another hotel near Hyde Park. The place gave us the creeps. And remember, we had one of their “Superior” Rooms. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

The place is totally run down. I have to agree with previous comments about it needing a makeover. Would probably be better to demolish the place. The place smells stale, the carpets furnishings and rooms</value><value> are all totally out of date. Looks like they shopped at a yard sale to furnish the place. They have the nerve to charge for almost everything they offer, internet, breakfast, video rental.  The place markets itself as gay owned and run. During the short time I was there I saw at least five straight couples.  If you are looking for gay accomodation avoid this place at all costs. If i was gonna stay in a straight hotel I preferred an upmarket chain closer to the city. Finally when I checked out the woman on reception didn't seem that bothered that I had only been there four hours and didn't question why I was leaving. Which makes me think it must be a regular occurence. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

We were informed that this would not occur and we should contact Qantas directly which we have now done, all to no avail. It appears we are responsible even though we did not receive what we had paid for - all apparently our fault - obviously doesn't pass the fairness test.

First impression was a nice studio room except for the scrappy worn mat at the door-a hazard to say the least. it had a balcony with nice view and on quiet side. Bed was comfortable except for the iron bed head that was very uncomfortable to lean against while watching TV. Cleanliness was ok with bed changed on request.

There was a nice cafe attached and buses very regularly from carillon ave and Missenden Rd-3mins walk. 5-10mins walk to King st with plenty of restaurants etc. Location was brilliant really.  However people in unit next door set fire to their unit-lots smoke but smoke alarms DID NOT WORK-hope this has changed.  Luckily it was daytime and another resident alerted everyone.

<item><hotel_name><value>Atelier Serviced Apartments</value></hotel_name><title><value>Should be closed down!</value></title><content><value>I'm disgusted that the owner of this dive appears to be exploiting its excellent location at the expense of their customers. I have the overwhelming impression that they simply don't give a damn! During our 7 night's stay our towels were not changed nor was our garbage bin</value><value> emptied. Disgusting, given that we paid almost $1,000 for our depressingly cramped room with broken vertical blinds and without airconditioning or wifi. I'm surprised this building passed planning permission as there is no air vent on the apartment's exterior wall and the only way to get some fresh air is to open the sliding door to the exterior ledge (it is not a balcony as it is only 60cm/2 feet wide) and put up with the incessant traffic noise coming from Carillon Avenue, which makes it impossible to get a good night's sleep. The range hood above the cook top is useless as it doesn't have a chimney connecting it to the building's exterior, which means the cooking fumes are merely circulated within the airless apartment. The bathroom is also poorly ventilated (embarrassing for toilet users) and the hand basin is at an uncomfortably low height (better suited for a child to wash their face in rather than an adult) and the cabinet above it is stupidly oversized. Do not stay in any of the street-facing studio apartments if the overnight temperature is going to over 19 degrees C as ours was an excruciatingly uncomfortable heat box, even with the fan on and the 'balcony' door wide open. The traffic noise was horrendous!  Clearly, there is an urgent need for air conditioning units to be installed as, in my opinion, these appartments are currently unfit for occupation.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

The TV had been taken away, but the TV channel guide was still there. There was an unusual white stain on one of the blankets, was best not to think of what it was. Some of the shared toilets hadn't been cleaned properly. There was construction outside at 3am on a weekend night, very annoying. We parked in a nearby parking garage and the hotel reception was supposed to stamp the parking receipt for a discount, but reception couldn't find the stamp so he gave us a printed receipt, but the parking garage didn't accept anything without a stamp and charged double the price. There's a reason the price is low, they do the bare minimum and give you horrid service in return. Go elsewhere.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

My partner and I planned a short trip to Sydney and chose to stay here after viewing the pictures they had online, what a big mistake. We arrived early so understandably we</value><value> were not able to check in, but when we did we were shocked. I thought someone had stolen the furniture. The room contained a small two seater couch, big enough for one person, a dining table and 2 small single beds put together to make a double bed.   The cleaning of the room must have been rushed as it was dusty and not appealing at all.  The bed was so small that my feet hung over the end of it, the tv did not work at all during our stay, and the staff couldn’t fix it, leaving us to use our mobile phone as a tv! The dishwasher was full of dishes that had been washed but left sitting what could only be said for days and smelt like it too.  The rooms are connected to the Oaks hotel, however to check in you need to go into the next building to get your keys then back into the Oaks, where staff did not even know the room existed.   We had paid for breakfast with our stay and book in staff were unaware of this, however they eventually supplied us with vouchers for a cafe down the road, which was the only good thing about this venue.  We used the pool area and it looked old and outdated, with a hole in the roof, one broken deck chair, a spa that didn’t work the first time and as for the heated pool, well it was cold!!  If you are looking for somewhere to stay, don’t stay here as there are many other choices around here. As the photos show, the room lacks soul, with around 10m square of emptiness, no pictures on the walls and very tired.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

The entrance is horrible &amp; dirty, with discarded cigarette ends strewn everywhere (it’s at the kitchen entrance of a restaurant &amp; right next to public toilets). The rooms are tiny &amp; the noise is really, really bad. The walls are super thin and I was woken up at least every hour by noisy guests, slamming doors &amp; talking (shouting) loudly. I’m not sure when the main photos were taken, but they look nothing like the hotel. It’s smelly, dirty &amp; noisy. The service was awful. There was no hair dryer in the room. No-one at reception until 9am &amp; when I called the out of hours mobile number, they just said I’d have to wait until 9. I was due to be at work at 8.30, but waited until 9 as I had wet hair... When someone did arrive at 9 and I explained, they said “I’m not working today, just leave your key on the table”, I asked them to repeat what they said &amp; they just snapped the same thing again. So I went to work with wet hair. No asking how my stay was, seriously no care in whether I did or not. Super cheap, but it’s true you get what you pay for (although I don’t even think I got what I paid for)... Just awful.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Dixon Residences</value></hotel_name><title><value>Poor</value></title><content><value>The entrance is filthy and is a bit obscure as this hotel is situated on the 3rd and 4th floors of a building and is directly above a karaoke bar that emitted loud music well into the morning for my entire stay. Bring earplugs! The elevator has an awful smell too and is never</value><value> clean. The bathroom is a big disappointment as it has two steps leading up the toilet and shower, which makes no sense at all and is a big hazard. There is also no exhaust fan so it always smells bad and requires a thorough cleaning as there is mould in the shower. There was no turndown service for my 3-night stay and therefore had to buy my own tea and milk as it didn't get replenished. Don't let the pictures fool you, the room is riddled with scuff marks/damage all over the room and it is very clear cleaning is kept to a minimum, as evidenced by the lamp covered in a thick layer of dust. I also didn't appreciate the 'queen' bed actually being two single beds joined together and therefore creating a very obvious and hard ridge in the middle of the bed. I stayed here because it was the cheapest hotel for my stay, but next time I'll go somewhere else regardless of the price.  It's right next to China Town if that is your kind of thing. Walking distance to Darling Harbor and shopping centers.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Fawlty Towers Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Hell from down Under</value></title><content><value>1st and foremost, the hotel is not call Fawlty Towers so if you are silly enough to stay here then make sure you mark it in as Peg Leg Inn. So from the name mix up already - after a long flight the last thing I needed was to find out the name on the accommodation is different</value><value> from the actuality.  Also - the basic amenities are all faulty. There is no lift so if you have heavy stuff then poor you - the idiot didn’t even offer to help.   There was no pleasant welcome just one flimsy piece of paper with the WiFi code and check out details. The only thing he communicated was that we as stayers are fortunate enough to receive 20% the food blah blah blah. But as the hotel gave me the creeps - I definitely did not eat here.  It’s a themed hotel - shipwreck vibe - if that means nothing to you that’s fine but it doesn’t sit well with me having to pass through ugly cheap basic skeleton decor in an accommodation that I booked for leisure . Our room had a flipping crack that was covered with cello tape ! - judging by how calm and unbothered these guys were I’m sure they think it’s part of the decor vibe so they are in no rush to fix it. The security of the building is also dodgy as people came in freely and never locked it.  The TV does not work and when mentioned (you have to walk all the way down stairs, out and back into the pub - the greasy manbun Guy was like ‘oooo that’s weird, come back and I’ll sort it’ ... cane back the next day and was rudely brushed off with ‘I don’t have my toolkit with me I’ll do it when I have it’ that was the second day of our 10 night stay and I’m still waiting after 5 days !  An open wire in the room near the tv and a random hole. The mugs given to us were dirty and the carpet smelled horrible - why would accommodation in Australia have carpet anyway? It’s tooo hot !  Two WiFi options never connected which was terribly frustrating . I would have to leave my room and go on the landing to get decent connection.  The shower also was blocked daily and not clean.  Do not stay here - go to ibis hotel or Sofitel .  The hospitality is worse than the dodgy craftiness of Jack Sparrow.  This place needs Gordon Ramsay to visit because I don’t understand how it’s running. It’s not a hotel, it’s not even a glorified hostel. Great location though.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Fawlty Towers Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>DON'T stay here..... look elsewhere !!!</value></title><content><value>This hotel has changed owners/names so many times. Lack of communication, no one answers when you try to ring them or return your phone call.  Finally arrived at hotel about 9am to find a door which had a keypad lock on it. No one available and the pub was not open either.  Rang</value><value> the hotel number several times, only to get a recorded message.  After a long midnight flight we were very tired and had no where to leave out suitcases, so we walked to the Star Casino and they were very helpful and let us leave our suitcases with them. After more phone calls and a couple of texts to the hotel number, we finally received a text to say that they will be opened after 12.  Finally got inside the hotel (which is now done at the pub over the counter on the corner) only to find out that we were on the top level although they emailed me confirmation to say that we would be on level 1, not much fun trying to get all our suitcases and carry bags up all those levels of stairs. Room was ok but very old and mould in the bathroom and no switch for the fan. Bedhead still had the cassette player with speakers !!!

<item><hotel_name><value>Sydney Darling Harbour Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>even before you step through the door they make you feel so welcome and nothing is too much trouble I love this place</value></title><content><value>It was my birthday, we'd just spent a while in the Blue Mountains with family and now it was time for a three day break at the darling. This has to be my favourite hotel in Sydney It is seldom that not just one but every member of the staff is so welcoming, so helpful and so</value><value> lovely, thank you all so much.   I received as beautiful card from them a bottle of wine, a box of chocolates and a plate of fresh fruit including my very favourite fresh figs..... Now how did they know that! Yes it is part of the  Star Casino but it it is a short distance away from the casino side,  but within the same complex.  There is the Casino hotel and there is the Darling I guess if you want to gamble the Casino Hotel closer, but we didn't visit the casino side sat all on this visit.     Our three days included a fabulous  included a fabulous breakfast, it was all part and parcel of the deal and I can assure you its a great breakfast, if you want to be a bit adventurous you can try their cooked meals as well as the buffet, remember though the name of the restaurant is Sokio so food will be a little different, however, on the buffet side there is just about all you could want, fresh salmon fresh juices, cheeses, salads, danish pastries, croissants  fresh bread or they will toast it for you the list goes on and on. I should warn you however, that it is is so very popular that for breakfast I would suggest getting down way before they close the kitchen, our first day we go were in a queue from about 9.30 and the kitchen closes at around ten I believe, so it was a bit of a rush by the time we got seated and rather noisy, well what do you expect when its so popular and no full!   The second morning we knew better and got down to breakfast around 8.45 there was no queue and we were seated pretty quickly so I guess its ups to you. wait in a queue and be there before the queue.     There was a photographic fashion show going on in the lobby on one of the days we were there, but don't think this is a usual occurrence,  but made good entertainment!  Our room was lovely had everything we needed including slippers and dressing gown  and bottled water.  seriously couldn't fault it apart from our ignorance in getting the right lights to work at the right time and the blinds to open and close at the right time!!   This was perhaps the only negative and I am sure easy to change.  The switches are all on the side of the wall  but  the names are so small and the angle not easy to read that we had to actually use a torch (even with the lights on) to see what lights we wanted down and whether we wanted the blinds up and down.   I am sure part of the would have been our problem as we had family with us and they didn't have the same problem but I can tell you it was a little difficult when switching off the wrong buttons we had blinds down and all lights off!!!! And if I may just add a bit of vanity here....... putting on make up in the morning wasn't that easy, the lights over the two sinks is great, not complaining, but when you look in the mirror, the lights are in such a situation that your head puts a shadow on them and to try to put on makeup or pull out that darned annoying whisker is not easy. I eventually resorted to the large very good hand magnifying mirror which I held close to the window to apply makeup etc.  The rain shower is fantastic, but here again, I did find a slight problem...... when you have used the soap or shampoo, the floor is very slippy I would suggest a slip mat would be a good idea.   However, nothing will ever stop me coming back here...... well, nothing that I can think of at this time.  I love the Darling, love the Staff, love the hotel, oh yes... perhaps a few more selective pillows, we had hard ones and when I asked if I could change them, no problems, but the ones they brought up were either toooooooo soft or latex hard.  I would love a dream pillow.  But still slept like a baby and had a fantastic three days.We have stayed at many hotel in Sydney, and am sure many of them are great hotels, of course they are, but to us, The Darling is our darling hotel, can't think of going anywhere else and the staff are also darlings...  Thank you for  yet another memorable stay and and for making my birthday so memorable and for just being you.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

But if you have a car, be</value><value> prepared to go looking for parking as there is no free overnight parking. The closest car park is just down the road but be prepared to pay. The staff was nice and friendly tho. The shared bathroom was a down side particularly when you needed to go to the toilet and someone got to the only working toilet before you. There is a communal kitchen which wasn't very clean though. You do get a discount for eating at the hotel downstairs. Don't call the hotel tel number as nobody ever picks it up.

<item><hotel_name><value>The Grand Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Good central budget accomodation</value></title><content><value>Stayed for three nights, it is not easy to obtain inexpensive city centre accomodation in most cities, so I was happy to find this one. There is no reception, you check in at the bar, we received a friendly welcome and the key to our room.  The lift is a challenge, two heavy</value><value> doors which have to be opened manually, not easy when you have luggage. Our room was basic but clean and comfortable, obviously it would be better if ensuite, but I was aware when booking that the bathroom was in the corridor and shared. However, it did not present a problem. The hotel is on a busy street so there is some traffic noise. This was compounded by road works which took place 24 hours,and looks as if it will be ongoing for some time to come, so earplugs would be a good idea. . Breakfast is DIY. The room is on the third floor, there are cereals, fruit, bread, etc.you serve yourself and wash up your dishes.You can use it 24 hours a day, and there is a microwave, so if you wanted to bring in some food to heat it could be a cheaper alternative to eating out, which is generally quite expensive. We ate one night in the hotels restaurant, the food was good and reasonably priced. The location is good, just a short walk to the opera house, and to Darling Harbour. The staff were all very friendly, we had a few drinks in the bar which was often busy, prices were about average. If you have flown to Sydney, you can get a train and the nearest station is less than five minutes from the hotel. If you don;t mind basic accomodation, then this is an ideal choice, we would stay there again.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

The building itself is old and gives a dirty first impression but it's not that bad at all. All in all I can say that you really get a nice stay with beautiful people around you for your money payed. Recommend it for everyone and would stay there again.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>City Central Budget Accommodation</value></hotel_name><title><value>It couldn't be worst</value></title><content><value>Worst hostel I have ever seen. There is a strong smell of mold in the hostel and the rooms and common area are really dirty. The floors are not cleaned very often for sure, because we found a lot of trash (including a pizza point half eaten...) and insects in the room. Our room,</value><value> the ''party room'' as other resident called it was so messy we could barely sit on the couch. I think the worst part was the employees. One of them (the one that was in charge of cleaning) was really rude and grumpy. We also got some of our stuff stolen and we really think that it was by this employee that really looked like he hated us. I felt really unwelcome to this place and I strongly recommend everyone to avoid this place.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>City Central Budget Accommodation</value></hotel_name><title><value>Don't stay here </value></title><content><value>Myself and a few friends stayed here for two weeks a few months back and it was the worst hostel we have stayed in. First off the manager Steve is the rudest man I have ever come across. He has no people skills what so ever, passive aggressive and  when you ask him simple</value><value> question he cant resist without a smart answer. His wife on the other hand is no better either, she doesn't have a clue. All she says is "talk to Steve" really rude individual aswell. The rooms are disgusting. On one occasion I even scrubbed the room myself with disinfectant only to find rotten food behind the fridge. When I told Steve, he for one didn't even say thanks for cleaning the room he just stood there with a stupid look on his face. Didn't even come down to check the room either to see how well we cleaned it. On the weekends there is noise like you would expect over drinking games which was great and we made friends there. What I didnt appreciate was the other so called manager "Roman" while he was on duty getting absolutely pissed and I've seen him do drugs in the hostel in other peoples room. What got me really annoyed, there was a noise complaint made and on Monday and Roman would come around and tell us off for being loud. He managed to blame everyone but took no responsibility himself even tho he was gurning his face off the night before. Absolute disgrace. Only two toilets and two showers in the whole hostel, easily waiting a good 30 mins before you can get in. My advice to you just move along they dont deserve your earned cash. There are better hostels close by. Never again would I come back to stay in a dump like that.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Orwell Lodge</value></hotel_name><title><value>An Overpriced Slum.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!</value></title><content><value>I have been to this location a number of times and more recently for a longer stay of many months.  This gave me a chance to see if legitimate concerns were ever addressed and if this was a short term problem.  It is not, this is a chronic fraud and this proprietor sees no need</value><value> in making anything right.  The conditions here are deplorable, that is true.  You are expecting to pay over $300/week (CASH) for a stay in a place that offers the following:  Infestations of roaches, maggots, and other bugs running all over the place.  I had bugs living under my sink that was not caulked at all, was loose, rusting and dropping rust bits all over the lower shelves.  Bugs living in the furniture, they'd come out at night and jump into bed with you.    Repairs here are done by those who'd not even be called hobbyists and of course are done wrong and in a slipshod fashion, all in all not safe.    I'd not trust wiring, electrical switches that are worn out and not wired properly, they will sit and arc when on since they are 1/2 on and 1/2 off.  Circuit breaker boxes are full of dead and live roaches making them a bug hut, since nothing is installed or wired right or sealed.  Getting up one morning it as as though I had been mugged, bites all up and down my arms, on my feet.    You would see maggots running across the bathroom floors, roaches living in garbage in the common and shower areas.  We were without hot water for weeks when a heater broke.  After it was "fixed" we had no hot water all day, only at off hours like 4am.  It was like this still many months later and to the point I left.  Showers are not cleaned properly, they have debris and other gunk on the walls next to the toilet, glass shower doors just sitting off the tracks next to the wall and shower enclosure, useless.  Some floors they are broke and have no shower heads with a sign telling us we need to use another floor for showers.  Laundry is useless and has no hot water, cold water wash only.  If there is any place you want to use hot water, it would be here at Orwell Lodge.  Housekeeping seems to just run around all day seeing who is paying at the front desk, and then making a stink or talking to others so you have to stand at the top of the stairs waiting for them to get out of the way.    She just walked into my room without knocking on numerous occasions, once while I was standing there in my underwear and once while I was asleep.  Completely odd.  For rooms that remain dirty and baths that are also, it seems all they do is generate chemical stink for no reason that we all have to breathe and then abuse the fixtures and toilets by slamming them shut all day long.  It is really put offish.  Abuse.  The proprietor is way too pushy on offers we need to attend a church since she claims to be a Christian.  She gets into personal attacks and offers she knows her customers (Who she has never met) better than we do.  It really is abusive and this is the next problem.  She seems to support violent harm to others and essentially says we are to blame and we need to get over it, in her opinion about things she has no witness of, she just says "so what?".  That ends it for me.  And should for you also.  I'd call the proprietor at this point a felon and liar.  AVOID this one at all costs.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>The Palms Backpackers</value></hotel_name><title><value>Nice atmosphere, middling quality</value></title><content><value>I stayed in this hostel for around 4 months and came back for another month later on. I have a soft spot for this place as it is a smaller hostel with a relaxed and social atmosphere. I found it an easy place to live because of that. I also found the people who ran the reception</value><value> nice to deal with but I'm aware they have since left.  The hostel is in a great location with Coles, Woolworths, Kings Cross station, and lots of eating and drinking options a short walk away. There's no clear sign outside so be careful not to walk past it. This is not a 24 hour hostel, so be aware that it can be tricky getting hold of reception sometimes. The free breakfast is basic but fine, and a big positive is the WiFi, which was free and almost always good quality, at least for me. There was a free computer to use, however it was broken last time I was there.  I would avoid the 12 bed room mainly because the small attached bathroom is in poor shape, with a constantly wet floor and little space. The room was fan cooled, and on particularly hot days got a bit stuffy but typically was fine. The kitchen did get hot when everyone was using it.  There was a decent amount of plug sockets in the room, though as with most Australian hostels I've visited, it could do with having sockets installed next to each bed. Storage space for each bed was given though, and the lockers were of decent size.  Free trips are sometimes offered, and I had a great time going to Palm Beach with a bunch of others from the hostel.  The overall cleanliness of the hostel is mixed. It is cleaned every day, but the kitchen soon gets dirty through the day. I did occasionally see cockroaches and I was told there was a rat problem, but didn't see any myself.  My biggest problem with this hostel was the fridge. To begin with it is too small for the amount of people and so you'll always have to cram your stuff in there. Plus it doesn't work! My food was melting and expiring because it simply wasn't cooling, probably because alongside being over-stuffed, everyone was directed to use FREEZER bags to deter pests, rather than mesh fridge bags. That needs fixing!  Overall, the nice social atmosphere and good WiFi balances with the facilities which can be lacking. Would I recommend it? That really depends on which parts of the hostel experience you value most, but it is certainly livable and usually enjoyable - just be aware of its shortcomings.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>The Palms Backpackers</value></hotel_name><title><value>Don’t waste your time here</value></title><content><value>Really poor, the staff here are so rude and disinterested. They all have other jobs within the city and therefore are working for accommodation to stay at the hostel but couldn’t give less of a f*** about making any effort. It’s a shame because it ruins other backpackers</value><value> experiences, when they have booked to stay at the hostel and their first impression is having to deal with staff that make you feel like you’re an inconvenience. It’s their job- if you don’t like it don’t do it?  It’s a small hostel so everything is quite crammed in and it’s very dirty. I wouldn’t have given this place a star but I had to. The location is okay (near kings cross) and there are some shops near by. To be honest the place could be a goldmine as any hostel in Sydney should potentially be. However it’s really poorly run, the management obviously don’t care about how it’s run (might be unaware of the staff) and it’s probably one of the worse hostels I’ve ever stayed in. Obviously you get what you pay for but a little consideration goes a long way.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>The Palms Backpackers</value></hotel_name><title><value>Terrible management </value></title><content><value>Do not stay there guys, honestly ! I spent almost 3 months there, the guests are really nice and friendly, rooms are a bit small but that's okay, kitchen is open 24h a day, that's a plus, but do not expect it to be clean after parties. Anyway, the worst point is the management.</value><value> The "receptionists" are untrained and unprofessional backpackers, they have no idea about what they're doing. Whenever you have a question they have to call the boss/owner. This man is the worst person I met in my life. He doesn't care about anything but its money. Be aware, you are not a human being to him, you are money. I had a problem for Christmas, I had a friend coming over from France I asked the mangers if it was ok for her to join us for the Christmas diner there was at the palms,they said ok. On Christmas Eve, after cooking for hours, we went there and my friend got kicked out. So she had to spend a bit of Christmas by herself in another hostel. This guy is inhuman, I mean the whole spirit of Christmas is solidarity, charity, gathering, laughing and having fun right ? That's not the kind of Christmas we had. How can you evict people like that, when you said yes on the first place ? Without even trying to give us a reason ! Because you can't talk with them, whenever you are trying to get an explanation, they all start yelling and they don't give you the chance to say a word... Other problem, to make a long story short: the owner made me pay for a bed that I didn't use for three weeks only in order to check in the day I needed. HE SOLD MY BED TO SOMEONE ELSe. I called him to have explanation and he had the guts to tell me loud and clear that I was annoying and driving him crazy and so, only because of that, he would cancel my reservation. How is that even a tiny bit professional ? I work in hospitality myself, I know some customers might be harsh to deal with but this is not a reason to get insulted and threatened. So this guy is the most unprofessional, rude, impolite, mean (and many other things) person that I've ever seen ! I strongly recommend to stay away from his hostel ! </value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Sydney Backpackers</value></hotel_name><title><value>One of best with a twist! </value></title><content><value>Sydney backpackers is located in the heart of Sydney - and I mean slap bang in the middle, you couldn't get more central - there is extremely easy access to the whole city being located just off George Street where you have an abundance of restaurants, cafes and bars at your</value><value> doorstep. Other must see places such as the Opera House and the Botanical Gardens are approximately a 10-15 minute walk away.   The hostel is close to many public transport links making it easier again to get around the city.   The hostel itself is nice, the staff (fellow backpackers) all seemed friendly and did what they could to help. Rooms were cleaned daily as were the communal areas.   Sydney backpackers also holds nights such as Taco Tuesdays and a BBQ every Thursday meaning you can socialise and get to know other people and their stories whilst travelling. The hostel also offers a basic breakfast every day included in the price you paid which is great to save money!   I would of happily given this place a 4* rating however on the last evening before I was going to leave I was walking up the stairs and I saw the BIGGEST cockroach which made me feel ill. I couldn't sleep properly the following night and I definately didn't go for breakfast on my final morning.  </value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

The rooftop terrace was pretty cool too :) They had a free BBQ night on Wednesday following a bar visit with a free drink include.

<item><hotel_name><value>Sinclair's of Surry Hills Budget Accommodation</value></hotel_name><title><value>Not as advertised</value></title><content><value>We booked into an ensuite twin room- it was much smaller than the room shown on the website.  We had bunks, as advertised, but with barely any space around them .  There was an electric jug and a fridge, but nothing else- no mugs or cutlery.  There was a ceiling fan which lazily</value><value> turned and a solitary window with a broken wooden slat blind and no fly screen- opening onto a communal smoking/ washing line space- the washing line was actually attached to a board nailed across the only window in our room.  For $160 it was pitiful.  We were lucky that it was not a hot night, otherwise it might have been too hot to sleep. To get to the room, one had to go up some old steep stairs with shallow treads.  The good part?  The mattresses were a decent quality foam mattress, so reasonably comfortable.  The room was clean, though meagre and old.  The staff were very pleasant.  The fitted sheets on the bunks were clean. It felt safe. The location was good, and our fellow residents were quiet.  But for $160, we expected a bit more.  There was barely room to move.  It was old and very tired.  It did not look like the ad on the website.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

The person whom was on duty was during my stay was very unhelpful and did not seem to care.

(We complained and the reasoning was that the contractors over the festive period have got confused about the shifts during our stay) not justifiable if you ask me.  - Kitchen: the hob and the Oven was turned off during all our stay and therefore we only had the microwave to cook anything with. It was impossible to actually get a full piece cutlery set. There was one fork on the whole premises.  - Housekeeping was poor.

<item><hotel_name><value>Glebe Space</value></hotel_name><title><value>Don’t waste your time!!! </value></title><content><value>How is possible to get something so wrong?!   Let’s start with the good - I stayed in the newer building, in a room with an en suite bathroom. The facilities in this building are lovely. But they could do so much better.   The rest -   Cleanliness - the room was dirty when we</value><value> arrived. Dust &amp; ants everywhere, clumps of hairs on the floor.   The money you save on booking here, you’ll spend on food, as they’ve turned off the cooking facilities (ovens and stoves). We booked her for two weeks, on our first day went and bought a load of shopping (trying to save money) only to realise the only thing you have to cook with, is a microwave! So for the large majority it’s either ready meals or take aways.   Apparently the ovens are turned off due to over sensitive fire alarms (more of these later!). We were told this has been a problem for two years now! So about those ‘over sensitive’ fire alarms. On our first night, after finding out basically nothing works here, the entire property was woken up at 1:30 by a fire alarm going off. Many had children and some of them extremely young (as it’s the summer holidays). There was a clear lack of leadership and I couldn’t even tell you where any of the staff from this facility were during the fire alarm.   A lot of things are misleading here - another being the WiFi. It’s only free in the newer building and even then, it doesn’t stretch to the common areas!   The cutlery and plates etc were a joke. A complete mismatch, when you take into account it’s full of families staying here, it’s difficult to find enough plates/cutlery to simply eat your meal. With this being paid accommodation, they could’ve at least bought some new kitchen stuff for the paying customers.   I’ve not been this disappointed by accommodation for a long time, if ever. Seems as if they’re honestly interested in making money with the university students are away.   In summary, please don’t waste your time or money. Yes it’s cheap but you’ll spend loads of food etc. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

When I checked at the front desk, the manager told me they'd sent me to the wrong lot.  Upon inquiring if anything could be done about the $55 charge (times TWO vehicles), I was told it was my own fault for going to the wrong lot since the right lot was posted in the lobby.

I have had no response after over a week.  "Hi,   My name is Nancy Burrows. I just stayed with you at The Village - Bondi Beach for 1 week. (01/10-08/10).  My stay for the week was truly awful.  To begin, I arrived on</value><value> Sunday (01/10) morning roughly 11:30am, to be told I could not check in until 2pm. This was fine and expected, and I was directed where to store my luggage. Before this I was told by the lady on reception that they were not able to put me in room 55 with my friends due to spacing issues, and that instead they would upgrade me from an 8-bed room, to a 4 bed room. I was happy.   When I finally checked in and got to my room (15), the room was so small I couldn't even fit my suitcase in, let alone open it. The room was full of luggage and there was absolutely no where to store my belongings, except for a broken drawer under the bed. I thought it was ridiculous that the lady had told me I had been upgraded to this room when I had paid for an 8 bed room, which is cheaper, and actually a lot bigger and nicer.   The bathroom was filthy, and throughout my weeks stay it was not cleaned once. The bins were changed and that was it. If a cleaning service isn't available then there should be cleaning material provided in the bathrooms. To make matters worse, the bathroom door was completely broken, it did not shut at all without really strong force, which I do not have. This is inappropriate due to the fact that I was sharing a room with 3 other males. This made me feel very uncomfortable and on edge.   Through out the week my stay got worse. There was mould on the ceiling and a leak, which dripped on my belongings and on my bed. I nearly slipped and fell in the middle of the night when I tried to get up to use the bathroom, due to the puddle on the floor. I also watched multiple people get tours of the hostel, which I was not offered. Our blind also did not shut, which meant that every morning light would shine into the room and wake me up earlier than desired.   Some of these issues are minor and I would have appreciated it being a hostel and not perfect, however due to the amount of issues I faced here it was a truly awful stay, and also unacceptable due to the amount I paid to stay here.   This hostel impacted my stay massively at Bondi Beach, which I had been looking forward to for months.   I hope you can take on board this feedback.   Thanks  Nancy"</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

Fined $30 to each of the 6 guests in the dorm, very rude receptionist who proceeded to take this money STRAIGHT out of our accounts. Legit? absolutely not.  The hostel has a serious amount of potential. But the 'management' couldn't run a bath.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

This is the WORST hostel I have EVER stayed in.  Rooms are dingy, dark, roasting hot and crawling with cockroaches. They were in my bed at night crawling all over me.  Reception is open six or seven hours in the middle of the day, right when you're out</value><value> doing stuff. Nobody around from 3pm-9am. Staff were nice but ineffectual (and one of them told me they wanted to quit because the management is so awful).   Wifi broke for five days - pretty much zero effort to fix it until enough people had complained. No lockers, broken laundry facilities   Worst of all - $50 worth of property was taken from our LOCKED room which only had my boyfriend and I in it, after a 'Spring clean'. I had to complain about this FOUR TIMES to reception before anybody took any action - despite saying they were looking into the matter I had to give descriptions of the missing items four times so they clearly didn't give a monkeys what had happened. One reception staff member even said this had happened several times since they had begun working there.   Spoke to the manager on the phone who was unspeakably rude. Immediately accused me of lying and refused to reimburse our loss. After lengthy email exchanges they have still offered no explanation as to what happened to our things and still refuse to take responsibility.  Place wasn't full over the busy Christmas period and people who had paid to stay there chose to leave and find other arrangements because they hated the place so much.   Absolutely NO information offered about Sydney or what to do in the area. NO information given about the hostel whatsoever - we weren't told the wifi password, how to get into the hostel, when the kitchens were open etc. Have NEVER experienced such little effort in a hostel.   Cannot express it enough - STAY AWAY!!!!!!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

Everywhere else in Sydney was booked as it was the Christmas/New Years holidays. We were told it was $30 a night but when the person that worked there thought we would find somewhere else, dropped the price to $25. Alarm bells</value><value> should have gone off then ! The place was dirty, smelly and infested with cockroaches and bed bugs. The bathrooms were a joke altogether. The kitchen couldn't even be called a kitchen. Lacked a couple of walls and a ceiling. To be fair the room was a decent size and the woman who worked there was ever so nice and chatty. I can safely say as a backpacker that I've seen many a hostel but this is one I will never step foot in again. It's a shame really because for the size and the location if it was done properly this could have been a little gem of a hostel! </value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Victoria Lodge</value></hotel_name><title><value>HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE! PLEASE DON'T!</value></title><content><value>Please red until the end:  1: The owner don't care about you, your needings, helping you or being kind. He just wants your money and that's it. He is very rude, annoying and disapointing... like he has always a horrible day and want the rest have a horrible day as well. He vomes</value><value> at 7am to complain about everything you are doing wrong in your life and leave at around 10am  2: There is no one taking care of the lodge. The reception is always closed and they barely clean the bathrooms/kitchen/common areas. Some people have loud parties with loads of drugs as nobody is there after 10am. They manage the bookings from the reception of another lodge (Springfield lodge) and don't care at all about this one, so if you have any problem you will have to solve it yourself.  3. They have a real problem with the bugs/spiders/snails/others. Terrible, please see the pictures. Being realistic, every day I had to kill or remove from 5 to 10 bugs, seriously, Im not exagerating, the first time in my life that I've found bugs in my pillow/matress (and I've been travelling around all asia).  4.NO WIFI. Seriously? At 2018 they dont even want to install a wifi service. Oh, and NO LAUNDRY with no option to even dry your clothes somewhere as the owner gets mad if he sees ypur clothes/shoes/whatever hanging on your window.  5. Serious maintenance problems. One day we woke up with sparks next to the bed... the water pipe was going right next over the electricity plug and had a leak, dropping the water on the electricity wires.  6. Fire alarm, fire detector and fire system is not working. In other rooms people smoking continously and burning incense or cooking inside and the fire detectors didnt even blink.  7. Lots of drugs and alcohol. They let young people  with drugs problems stay in there as long as they pay. As I personally saw every day people comming in amd out constantly, to buy drugs at one of the rooms. At night people get really drunk, they bring friends from outside that sometimes steal or disturb you and other times they pee/poo/puke in the back terrace.   8.Horrible bathrooms. Dirty, messy, smelly and with broken tiles.And also smelly and moldy rooms.  9. After all, comletitive price in a very centric location, as single room is 260 and double is 360, but if you dont want to be annoyed everyday and start every morninf with headeache, avoid this place, 100% honest.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

We were wrong. I left the hostel with 40 bed bug bites in my body. There were about 8 sets of bites in the legs, arms, stomach, back. The bites are horrible, take about 15 days to fade away</value><value> and itch terribly. The photos are with the review. The husband also was bitten. Never seen such a large amount of bugs. The infestation was such that we could kill several in bed during the day.  Unfortunately we did not know what they were. It was not possible to been brought by us (we arrived from Hong Kong) because that large amount of bugs we could not have carried with us. The kitchen and bedroom are also breeding grounds for cockroaches. It was difficult to use the kitchen because cockroaches kept falling into the pots and pans, they walked on the stove. A freak show. Only stayed in the hostel because we paid upfront and the manager is ill tempered and also because we did not have other options unless we agreed to pay U.S. $ 107 / 100 AUD in other hotels. We did not talk to the manager because reading other reviews we knew he would throw us out and I am sure he knew about the bugs.We paid $ 75 / AUD 70 for a double room with shared bathroom. In the bedroom there was a closet (infested with insects), sink, mini bar, electric kettle, a table and two chairs.

We decided to stay as it seemed quiet (which it was) and he only charged us 50 USD for a twin room with a balcony which we enjoyed sitting on. The room its self was a bit mouldy and smelt bad so we had to keep balcony doors open. The manager is also funny about his kitchen we only cooked in there once as although he insists on keeping it clean and you must wash and put away everything before you eat the actual kitchen is filthy. Because its in the garden bugs fly into the kitchen and its unhygienic. The manager seemed to get nicer over the four nights we were there and didnt want us to leave. I would only stay here if you are on a budget.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

There is no vibe, you're not going to make</value><value> friends for life here. The rooms are way too small, dirty, and there's only 2 plugs for the entire room.   The cleaners are really annoying. Their list if check-outs is never correct, meaning that every day they came to our room and started cleaning random beda while nobody was checking out. This made a lot of people losing their stuff. My book and sunglasses disappeared from my bed after it was cleaned, and when I told the staff, they wouldn't believe me.  Next to that, while I was staying, one night, the owner came back to the hostel at around 01:00 am, very drunk, and started singing out loud in the hallways and jamming on the doors.

After a long trip were unable to be checked in. We were told they would call us when they our room was ready. Had to come back because we had to leave for the concert. We told to wait for a long time before we were served, and service was awful.

We got a call at 6:30pm saying our room was ready. There is also no parking near by.  Returned late from the concert, were given our keys. After trekking up 3 flights of stairs, our keys did not work. When the guy fixed our keys, the room had someone in it. Finally got into our room. It had not been cleaned. Had rubbish in the bins, rubbish in the bathroom, the previous owners toiletries in the bathroom (which they came back for at 6am).

I rang the "after hours" reception service, who made vaguely apologetic noises, and said they would get the manager to call me, an hour later I called again and was told the they couldn't get the toilet fixed that night, or move my collegue to another room. I then made them call the manager again. Eventually, he called me and explained that there was nothing he could do, and there would be a plumber in at 8am to fix the toilet. I indicated that this wasn't good enough, and he just fobbed me off with excuses. So, I called our coordinator back in Melb, and we arrange to move out the next day, to Quest Potts Point, (which I can highly recommend). Finally, after going back to my dirty smelly apartment for the night, I found a used condom lying on the window sill. Needless to say, when we moved out the next morning(at 11), there was no sign of the promised plumber.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

I was meeting friends for dinner that night so I went out pretty soon after arriving, the  general appearance of the room was clean so I was happy especially for the price paid $436 for 3 nights. I returned to the hotel later that night being tired I cleaned my teeth and popped straight into bed. Wrong! I am not going to go into graphic detail however you can imagine my absolute horror and disgust  when I awoke the next morning to find I had slept in “dirty” sheets that were certainly not of my making! I felt physically ill! Apart from the “mess” in the bed it was obvious the bed had just been pulled up as the unslept side of the bed the sheets had not been tucked in. This is where not having an onsite reception is a real  problem as you cannot just ring down to complain. The staff I contacted at the other hotel were not as apologetic as I would have expected they just told me to go out and they would change the sheets! I did stay there for another 2 nights as I had a busy few days planned and it would have been a hassle finding alternate accommodation.  There was no  further apology or offer of compensation in any form.  So a word of warning check the bed before hopping in!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Parkridge Corporate Apartments</value></hotel_name><title><value>Don't Even Think Of Staying Here, Unless You Want Fleas</value></title><content><value>We were booked to stay here for four nights, but only stayed one nght. We would have been gone as soon as we got to the motel if we had another motel to go to, but as it was night time, we had nowhere else.  As soon as we saw the carpark, we knew the rest of the motel</value><value> (apartment) was not going to be good. Then we smelled curry from the people taking residence in the apartment. The walls were cracking and peeling and desperately needed paint.  It smelled of dust and mould, we could not sit on the couches because, as my sister said, it looked like someone had died and decomposed on them. Out of curiousity, I looked in the drawers. There were bits of dirt in there. Anyone planning to use any of the cooking utensils would have to have been desperate.  The toilet paper was cheap, Black and Gold. You would think they would have hidden the packaging, but no, it was left in the toilet for display! The towel rack was held on with masking tape, which was brown. The water in the bathroom would not turn off, and there was no hot water in the shower or toilet. On the bathroom sink, there was a hair. And it was not a head hair.  Each bed only had one pillow, meaning that we had to put our clothes underneath and fold the pillow in half in order to have some comfort. The blankets were so dirty that we did not sit on the bed while they were there, to avoid the very likely case of getting fleas or some kind of disease, and we took them off before trying to go to sleep.  It was a Saturday night, and the nightclub across the road was so noisy that we didn't get any sleep until 3:00 AM. They kept playing annoying music, too. Long music, like 'Stairway To Heaven' and 'What Goes Around Comes Around'. Whilst I attempted to go to sleep, I put my  folded pillow on the bedside table to be more comfortable, which didn't work out. I even tried sleeping on the wrong end of the bed to try to get away from the noise and be more comfortable. Because we had no blankets, we were cold.  In the morning, we left as early as we could... or we tried to. The gate wouldn't let us out, meaning we were trapped for possibly more than thirty minutes.  The best, and most valuable part of the motel was, shamefully, the 'Sydney' book.   I would not recommend this apartment to anyone with higher standards than feral people who let their houses get this way.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

As for the pool, it was OK but lime build up or some kind of build up was evident on the pool floor. The spa was closed and I dare say by the dust and dirt and tile pile up it had been closed for quite some time, very disappointing!!!

The amiable front-desk staff must have also overlooked reminding us of the DST on the day the airport shuttle would be picking us up. The noise from the street does get into the room, so maybe a good soundproofing has to be done and the elevator seems to bounce back before it stops.

The screen that</value><value> cover the windows did not fit and were bent, allowing all sorts of creatures into the room.  The curtains were dirty with food.  The balcony was grubby - dead plants in pots, cigarette buts everywhere, dirt all over the floor.  Very hot in the summer (It's January now) and the small fan in the room did not help much (obviously no air conditioning).   At seven AM the nieghbors started playing the TV very loud.  Walking through the weedy, unkempt inner courtyard you can smell the cooking form the rooms and see the shared bathrooms,  There was a guy urinating in plain view - didn't bother to even close the door.  It felt and looked like something out of a movie.  I suppose if you have no expectations and are a young backpacker with little experience this would be ok.  But for $20-40 more a night you can enjoy a real room in a real hotel in a much nicer location.  Sure, Balmain has lots of shops and you can take the bus to the ferry wharf - but that's true of many places in Sydney.  I decided to leave, without a refund, after one night.

<item><hotel_name><value>Surfside Bondi Beach Backpackers</value></hotel_name><title><value>Just awful.</value></title><content><value>If you’re in Australia and have become accustomed to the relatively high standard of hostels, where you feel safe, clean and meet knowledgeable staff then this hostel is not for you. If however you’ve been homeless for years, or are looking to punish yourself for whatever reason</value><value> then it’s time to book a bed! This has got to be the WORST hostel I’ve ever stayed in. It should be illegal that the property is advertised as a hostel, when their main source of revenue emerges from scamming backpackers out of their hard earned cash. On arrival, we were greeted with additional charges - $3 for the ‘free’ equipment hire and a further $50 deposit. The $50 deposit was very shocking due to the fact it seemed almost impossible to create $50 worth of damage within the dark, hot and smelly (oh, so smelly) hostel rooms. Moreover, if you did want to use the ‘free’ equipment, then you would also have to pay ANOTHER $50 deposit. That’s $103 that you’re never going to see again due to a very rude and arrogant Australian version of Victor Lustig (sorry, Victor). To make things worse, there’s two toilets and two showers to share between each floor, and during my stay I did not see any attempt of improving the hygiene. Pubic hairs and skid marks galore, yuck. Prepare yourself to queue up for the toilets and come out of the showers feeling dirtier than you previously were. The beds were crusty, uncomfortable and let out a large creek at any movement. Combining this with the fact there were no power sockets or railings on the top bunk, I wish risked being swarmed by mosquitoes and slept on the beach. Due to our complaints, when we checked out we didn’t get our deposit back as the manager didn’t like our tone. The manager, some breaking bad hank looking mother trucker, was without a doubt one of the rudest people I’ve ever encountered. Usually, having the staff deliver a big smile in your direction is a sign of good hospitality. This was not the case however as the sick grin was attached to the image of the manager shoving our cash deposits into his deep greedy pockets. This was clearly not his first rodeo.

Nice outdoor seating area for meals, socializing, etc.  We used Booking.com to make the reservation, as this makes things simple.  It would have been helpful to attach "youth" to the hostel name because youth predominate.  The place is run by young adults, and most of the guests appear to be just out of school -- with the predictable loose interpretation of house rules.  Noise curfews are observed based on individuals' ethics and good neighbor concept, and seemed decent  in the common areas.  But not in the bedrooms at all.  Expect selfish behavior after hours.  And we agree with commenter "clevertraveller2017" on the charging policies.  This place does not have a fair early checkout procedure.  In order for us to leave early (as our itinerary called for), we had to leave a (supposedly refundable) room key deposit on our credit card and then drop the keys into a mail slot in the office prior to out departure.

I will be looking for other accommodation next trip.  Breakfast is $18-25 or thereabouts but not really much choice- I did get gluten free bread when requested, along with poached eggs.

<item><hotel_name><value>Lamrock Lodge</value></hotel_name><title><value>The Village Bondi Frathouse</value></title><content><value>Most travellers staying at this place are usually here for 2 reasons. First would be the cheap price and secondly the location is just a block away from the beach. With that said this place does attract many surfers and people who love the beach. That's why I picked this place. </value><value> The buliding seems rather old and with any old building there are some bugs. I did see a couple cockroaches but once we cleaned or area and kept food stored away properly here didn't seem to be many after. The room I stayed in was for 4 people and it was a nice mix of young travellers. There was free WiFi, a TV with a couple of stations but NO air conditioning. Keep in mind I was there at the end of summer and the nights were rather cool. Now if it was in the hot summer months I'm not so sure I could sleep with that high heat. The lodge is situated on a nice quiet street just off the main street going around Bondi beach. There was a big fruit trees outside my window and in the morning there were parrots which was so cool but at night big fruit bats which was freaky.  The showers and bathrooms were adjacent and there could be 2 people in each shower and one in the toilet all at the same time. There's 3 floors and all have multiple washrooms and showers. FYI you have to bring your own towel. There were cleaners that go throughout the building daily and also do weekly (Sat) room clean ups. The staff was very friendly except for this power tripping douche security guard. Just ignore him as he seems to want to pick fights with foreigners. There are vending machines, laundry on-site and a very small kitchen (watch your head).  All in all its a very cheap place to stay close to the beach so don't expect the Hilton hotel or anything super fancy. There's a grocery store a couple blocks away and buses just down the street where you can get to downtown Sydney in 30mins. The people are a younger crowd and a frat like surfer beachy vibe. I did like my stay and it was unbeatable for the price.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

Our room was very poor. No fly screens, dirty, no bins emptied, cockroaches and no service to the room on the four days and no air conditioning.    Yes, we booked an extra night before we left home</value><value> as our daughter had a meeting in Sydney. We paid extra for parking but daughter had to park on the street one night as the parking spots were obviously over-allocated. Our daughter's room was better, but complained about people sitting outside her door all night smoking and talking and the cockroaches- the front office lady did something about this early on which was helpful although people still smoked under the outdoor area which came into the room.  She has three small children so was not too happy.   On check out, we were told we had paid our bill all was fine, but when we got home and checked they had charged us an additional $86 including the parking. We will never go there again or refer anyone to the place.  Our son also booked a room on Friday and Saturday nights and he was very hot and didn't sleep due to the bed and the heat from the fan in their room not working.  The position was close to the beach and the lady looking after the place for the owner was helpful and very kind. She helped make the stay a little easier.

I was having the best time ever in my life almost, but unfortunatly something happened. The only problem was that, after 1 or 2 months of stay(i was working in Sidney), there was a guy in the hostel that went to the manager to tell him  something that wasn' t  even true and then i got kicked out without a good reason.

<item><hotel_name><value>Darlinghurst Apartments</value></hotel_name><title><value>Almost ruined our girls weekend </value></title><content><value>This place is situated on a busy road, a thin wall or set of windows separating any chosen room (which are dank and dusty and cheaply furnished) and the nightclub Oxford Circus ( which is open 7 days 9pm-3am). The walls were vibrating with the sounds of deep base and trance</value><value> music all night causing a horrible night for myself and my bridal party who booked this place for a girls weekend to find a wedding dress for myself. One of the beds was broken (slats literally snapped in the middle), bathroom had poor facilities( open half empty bottle of body was probably left by the last poor soul who booked this place) and sponges and cleaning equipment provided in the kitchen filthy with hair and mould.  When booking; nothing about noise was explained to us- even though we met the owner in person as she let us in who stated prior in a confirmation email that is was "young people friendly" and "accessible to the party scene of oxford street" or some alluding quotes along those lines. Payment was also needed upfront with a strict "no refund" policy- NOW WE KNOW WHY!  After a tiny pocket of sleep between 3-6am ( before loud music, traffic and the morning commuters woke us again) we contacted the owner to let her know we couldn't stay.  We were met with a hostile, rude and defensive response so much that we had to terminate the conversation with her on the phone  and explain we were leaving regardless via text message.

However, I have to say the level of cleanliness seems to have gone several notches compared to earlier reviews.  Although I still washed every item I used</value><value> before using it.   I must say the requirement to empty the bin before leaving had me a trifle astonished too as it is not a quick and easy process involving as it does a walk down Oxford St (with your rubbish in hand) to the adjacent side street and then down it  and along the back lane to the bins.  That alone is enough to put me off ever staying here again.  The weather conditions in Sydney were mild during our stay so we were comfortable enough.  However, being on Oxford St, the place is noisy and the extractor fan from the pizza place downstairs runs up the rear wall so even the back bedroom is not spared from noise.  My advice - bring earplugs.  I did, and actually slept quite well wearing mine.  The stairs to get into the apartment are quite precipitous and will not suit anyone with impaired mobility.  The location is handy to St Vincent's Hospital and to the city.  I would say forget Oxford St and try the eateries down Victoria St if you're dining out.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>City Lodge</value></hotel_name><title><value>Tired and in need of a makeover.</value></title><content><value>It's hard to say anything good about this hotel, perhaps it's only redeeming quality is the location. It is a stone's throw from Wyndam Train Station and there are places to eat downstairs, about 15 minutes walk to the Opera House. The entrance to this establishment is a full</value><value> size glass door sandwiched between 2 shops. On opening the door you are immediately confronted by a considerably tall staircase leading up to the second floor (which is the first floor of the hotel). There are no elevators, so beware, you will be dragging your bags up. And if you are elderly or in anyway physically disabled you will find it a challenge. The first floor contains the reception, some rooms and a communal kitchen and living area, both of which I would consider unnecessary in this location. Checking in and out was easy and the lady behind the counter was friendly and helpful. My room was quite small, just big enough for the double bed and side tables. There is a wardrobe which has a mini fridge and safe inside. The carpet was badly stained and dirty, paint was bubbling on the walls and it was very dusty. For me, the bed was way too soft and the water pressure in the shower was almost nonexistent if you want a hot shower! There was no aircon that I could see, only an old style electronic bar oil heater. Tea and coffee making facilities and an average flat screen TV on the wall with average reception. As I was only staying for one night I put up with it but I can't recommend a longer stay. I was told that it will be renovated soon, I certainly hope so as it would take a big improvement for me to return.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

There is no elevator, so we had to carry our bags up four flights</value><value> of stairs (and back down when we left).  We had to be careful about showering because the steam would set off the fire alarm, causing a fine of over $1600.  The mattress was so hard it was no better than sleeping on the floor.  The advantage of the mattress was that it was clean.  The floor was not.  It had not been vacuumed since before the previous tenant.  (I found hair on my socks after walking across the floor.)  In other words, avoid this hotel at all costs.

I am a 25 year old so I can understand we are all in Australia but it was worse than being a 16/17 year old in Malia or Ayia Napa people falling all</value><value> over the place acting like children and having no respect for their neighbours.   As I arrived the man behind the counter seemed completely uninterested to help me saying that my key was in the box. What box? I've just arrived. He didnt tell me the code to the main entrance and didnt tell me where my room was I literally paid and was left to find my own way.   I entered the room and there was a 50 year old Aussie guy who claimed that he was a journalist so lived out of hotels. I was already sceptical as he was living out of carrier bags. All I am going to say is the guy was WEIRD. Making noises throughout the night, touching himself inappropriately, getting up and going for a walk at 2am in the morning. A lot of hostels in Australia have a policy of non locals and I understand why now. You get some absolute creeps staying otherwise.  In the morning I was woken up at 7.30am to people shouting. Some people laying in the street (presumably from the night before) and it just had no class.   I feel whilst writing this I am sounding like a fun sponge but realistically there is a huge difference between letting your guests pour onto the street falling all over the place and shouting until the early hours and being respectful to your customers and neighbours.   If you are looking to get smashed and hang around with a bunch of people who have been allowed to leave their parents for the first time this is the ideal place for you.   </value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Edgecliff Lodge Motel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Do NOT stay here, no matter how cheap!</value></title><content><value>Having read other reviews of this place, we were apprehensive as to what we might arrive to. However, being between Xmas and NYE, it was all we could get.   It claims to be 3 stars, however according to the Australian hotel star classification, it would only be 1, maybe 2 at a</value><value> push.   There is no WiFi unless you're in reception (or very close to) and you get 1 hour free, then it's paid only.   When we arrived, we checked our room to find it a bit smelly, very small etc so we asked for another room but that was exactly the same.   In our room, you could not get to the toilet without first stepping into the shower cubicle, then closing the door before stepping out the shower.   They have taken all toasters out of the rooms so you cannot set off the fire alarm, which is fair enough; however the policy in place is a joke. You have to go to reception and deposit $50 to hire one whilst you make your toast, then return it immediately. This can only be done at breakfast time. One evening after a long day, one of our group simply wanted some toast for tea (this was 9:30pm) but was told we cannot have a toaster at this time because it's 'too late'. Never ever came across this in any hotel, EVER.   We are clearly not the only people to think poorly of this hotel - someone has enscribed 'the worst hotel' on the ceiling above the bunk bed in our room.   Also, there is nowhere really to store luggage.   It's comparable to a hostel, if you were to have a private room.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Edgecliff Lodge Motel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Did the job but....</value></title><content><value>Ill start of with some negatives  Entering the room at check in around 2pm there was a bad stench. Smelt like Asian food that had gone off. Was terrible. I keep a small can of Glen 20 in my backpack and gave the unit a good spray, helped. But when entering the unit later that</value><value> night could smell the stench again, had to Glen 20 again.   Around 430pm had a quick knock on the door and an Asian lady entering briskly. I intercepted her and inquired why is she coming in? Said to give me milk, which I already hade two small cartons in the fridge. This is not a good look and felt privacy may be  an issue here. There is no "do not disturb sign" and you have to question security of the room if you leave to go out. I suggest to Edgecliff Lodge, when someone has checked in, a phone call to the room or a note under the door would be more appropriate than just waltzing in. We want to feel safe and secure, My stay I did not  The bread in the fridge (for breakfast) seemed a few days old. I had a little bit of the fruit bread but couldn't muster it, the white bread was worse. Toasting it would have made it better I guess but couldn't be bothered picking up the toaster from reception and possibly setting of the alarm   Other than the above problems, I found the stay ok. Yes the place is old and some furniture should be replaced. But got a good nights sleep and it ticked couple of the boxes I needed for my stay. There is a sink with small bench and cutlery in the bedroom. There is also free undercover parking, but its limited, maybe 16-18 spots?? If you check in before 3pm id imagine you will get a spot, otherwise you may need to park on the road or side street.  There is Coles supermarket up the road, 5min walk, and a bunch of cafe's and takeaway places as well. Edgecliff train station is in that vicinity as well. The service and friendliness of reception was good  Would stay again, but would definitely check out the room for bad smell before taking the key for the night, as well as bring limited valuables to the room.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

COMPLETE RIP OFF !!!    I have stayed at better backpackers in SE Asia then this dump !! I stayed in room 17 or 18 which is part of an Edwardian property adjacent to to the main Motel.   The room is small and has no real room to sit down anywhere apart</value><value> from the bed. The room has no A/C so if it is a warm night you will get very hot. It does to its credit have a ceiling van but unfortunately this creaks on every rotation so it keeps you up all night. The mattress on the bed is just awful. I really think it was 4cm of foam!! I was not brave enough to properly inspect it. You will not a get a good nights sleep on it. The bed slats also collapsed during our stay so one night we had to spend 30 minutes rebuilding the bed !!  But wait that is not the worse!! The bathroom is the real shocker. The first think you notice is the pungent smell. Then the tiles are grubby and dirty.  It looks like a 12 year old did the tiling and grouting...or someone very drunk !! Then you will notice that the bath need replacing as there is rust on the base of it. The next joy is getting into the bath to have a shower. Once your feet stop sticking to the base of the bath you then have to be a plumber as the taps keeping falling off. Once you have mastered this then the water is either so hot it sill scold you or so cold it will freeze you....getting the temperature anywhere in between is impossible. But at least you can sit outside on the balcony and have  a nice glass of wine...but surprise, surprise none of the lights work so you are sitting there in total darkness. I did mention this to management ( l use this term loosely as l am not sure he was as he did not give a give a dam about my concerns) but l think it was all to hard for the poor bloke.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

It suited what we wanted - a well located place to crash at night after sight seeing, and at $99/night for our family of three,  it was good value. There was parking and in such a handy location we didn't need our car. Our one criticism was noise from other occupants talking on the second night. There is a central courtyard and the sound echoed.

<item><hotel_name><value>BreakFree on Clarence</value></hotel_name><title><value>Not too good, not too bad</value></title><content><value>I would like to point out that I have spent 30 nights in this hotel, so I can assess the quality of the room number 205 on the 2nd floor.  Plus : The central location in the CBD is great. The new lift is very nice. The free use of a washing machine and kitchen as well as the</value><value> free Wi-Fi are a plus. The fridge is ok. The small hot water kettle including coffee, sugar, milk and tea are a good thing. The toilet works well. The hand and bath towels are fine. The shower is big enough. The hair dryer is a plus. The blackout of the room with 2 curtains is good. The TV is big enough and has an HDMI connection.  Minus : There is no breakfast. The windows do not close properly, so there is a hell of a noise at night because of the central location. The windows also cannot be opened properly. The outer windows have not been washed for years. The view is zero. The room does not have a chair or a desk. The room lighting is poor. The bed is only 90cm wide and not very comfortable. In the closet hang only 4 (four) hangers. There are not enough clothes racks in the closet. The safe does not work. There is no shelf for the suitcases. The air conditioning is always too cold. The provided soaps and shower gels are not very good. The washbasin is far too small, there are no shelves for toothbrushes and company. With every face wash I provoked a little flood. The hot and cold water control is not very reliable and must be constantly readjusted. The toilet paper is too thin. The shower is not cleaned thoroughly enough. The carpet could be cleaner. In general, room service is only average. The television program is a disaster. The hotel does not have a lobby.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

It looks like it previously was an old backpackers now trying to be a hotel. Tiny rooms, which I don’t mind normally but not even one bedside table. I understand that it is cheap but it should be clean and have basic working</value><value> furniture this unfortunately was not the case.  The sink and bathroom door obviously doesn’t get cleaned, the bed was broken and on a slant, the vinyl bed head was covered by a pillow to reveal it had been scratched off in obvious places and the only chair was so damaged I wasn’t going to sit on it. Stains on the floor next to the bed and the window sill covered in dirt. The tv was facing the wall and there was no where to sit and watch it on.  Considering how tiny the room was I can’t believe it wasn’t cleaner. It is really sad as the location was not too bad. Recommendations, a good spring clean with a good working vacuum, a couple of chairs or a bench seat at the entrance as there is no where to wait for people.  New beds, desk and chairs in the rooms. Go to Kmart at the very least. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

Le point positif est sa proximité avec Central Station et le quartier chinois qui</value><value> fait qu’il y plein de commerce aux alentours.

Des frigos où le ne peut pas mettre beaucoup de nos affaires, ou il faut se battre pour avoir de la place.  La propreté en générale est assez sommaire, mais d’un niveau correct pour un hostel.  Le wifi est aussi un peu un point négatif car il fonctionne avec des vouchers de 1GB, les vouchers sont dispo à la réception donc il faut en prendre un certain nombre d’avance, mais le débit est plutôt rapide.  Sur l’ambiance de l’auberge c’est à chacun de l’évaluer mais je n’ai pas trouvé l’ambiance conviviale d’une auberge c’est dommage.

There was ONE usable hob, there rest were broken, and everything felt a bit grimy. I'd say it was borderline unusable. The only positive there is that there was plenty of fridge and storage space. But to make things worse they ask for a deposit to get a plate and cutlery - pretty rich when the kitchen is so poorly stocked and maintained to begin with.  Everything here needs improving, and given the number of hostels in the area, there are much better options nearby for a similar price.

Everything negative that others have written is true.  My daughter is currently sleeping on the floor because the sofa bed is so uncomfortable.  The mattress has springs (can't remember coming across</value><value> such a thing in the past 30 years!) and you can feel every one of them.  The pillows are so flat you might as well not have one and the sofa/lounge chairs have a very peculiar odour.  We are going out tomorrow to buy an inflatable bed so that she can at least get a semi-decent sleep.   Once the sofa bed is out you can't walk out of the bedroom without stepping over it and anyone wanting to use the bathroom has to come through the bedroom.  This is definitely a two-person unit and suitable only for people who do not like to look outside as there is no balcony or window looking beyond the fence outside.

<item><hotel_name><value>Bondi Beach Holiday Apartments</value></hotel_name><title><value>A real disappointment </value></title><content><value>We “tried” to checked into Bondi Beach apartments upon arrival in Bondi, we knocked on the door which said “office” and “please knock before entering” to which there was no response. We waited a couple of minutes &amp; then proceeded to call the number provided, after a few confused</value><value> conversations with someone who was sitting on the other side of the door we eventually got our keys &amp; into the apartment. No talk of facilities or WiFi or help of any sort.  The apartment is “fine”, not large by any means, there was 3 of us so we have a sofa bed and a double bed, this meant the room to move was limited &amp; by this I mean we barley had space for the three of our suitcases on the floor.  The WiFi is offered at an additional charge &amp; the Safe didn’t work at all.  The only thing I can praise about this facility is the location, it’s located on Hall Street, just 5 minutes walk from Bondi Beach &amp; surrounded by loads of really good restaurants.  The first morning we were awoken by continuous drilling in the room next door, we got ready and left, hoping it was a once off, it wasn’t! This drilling continued every morning, from 8am! On the 3rd morning we went to reception where they told us there was a leak and as an emergency it had to be fixed. This had never been brought to our attention before we complained. There were talks of moving apartments and that they would look into it but we got a text message later that day to say there were no other rooms available and they were offering us a *very small* monetary contribution, this amount didn’t even equal one nights stay!   As we had no where else to stay, we stayed in the apartment for our intended length, the drilling changed to starting at 12 some days but was still constant once it started.  When it came to check out, there were no instructions as to how to proceed. A booklet in the room said to call Tara for any queries or questions, Tara informed us she hadn’t managed this building for 3 years so she was no good to us. There was an emergency contact by the lift, which we rang and never received a response and a week later still haven’t received a call back, I dread to think what would happen if there was a real emergency!   The location of this facility is the only thing it has to offer, I think the rooms are being renovated (and this was the reason for the drilling, not a leak) but the cosmetic look of the apartments won’t make up for the ignorance and rudeness of the people running the building.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Bondi Beach Holiday Apartments</value></hotel_name><title><value>Avoid unless your desperate</value></title><content><value>I really wish I would have read the reviews before booking this place. However the studio I booked was for my parents who were coming to visit me from Ireland and I didn't really have a choice as the place I had for them originally fell through last minute.  I viewed two rooms</value><value> the night before my parents arrived. The smell was the first thing I noticed in the first room (apartment #9), it was old and looked dirty. The second room (#12) was not much better but did not have a funky smell and seemed brighter/airy. The room had not yet been made up from the previous people left - there was rubbish, dirty linen thrown around. I was assured the studio would be clean before the morning.   My parents asked to see the room before paying, if was still dirty. (I believe there was actually condoms lying under the bed). They asked for it to be cleaned again. In the end my mum actually took to the place with bleach. I gave the rental people the bond on my credit card, I have never had a person in customer service speak so rudely. When she advised there was a $15 CC charge I asked could i call in to the office and pay it in cash. In short, she gave me no choice telling me that she would put my parents on the street, she was leaving at 2pm that day and didn't have time for me to come in to the office.   The worst bit about this is they said they charge $100 cleaning fee and they would take it from my bond....with no choice. The place was filthy to begin yet they charge every person who stays there $100 to clean it for the next people???  To sum it all up - unless you want to feel like you've been robbed of your money. threatened and placed in a property that you could catch a disease from- AVOID this place. Genuinely still shocked by the whole situation.  In hindsight, we could have paid half the price in one of the backpackers in Bondi and it definitely would have been better service, cleaner and more friendly.   Really shocked that this place is allowed to operate.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

Horrible people to deal with and literally don't give a toss about you once they have your money. The apartments are reasonably comfortable in a rough type of way</value><value> yet not so clean at all and with a $100 cleaning fee at the end of each rental you would think they'd at least get that bit right The utensils and kitchen leaves a lot to be desired, dirty cutlery and food stuck all down the side of the cooker plastic glasses and only one cup. No toilet roll supplied at all dirty tissues below the bed and good knows what else. Exceptionally rude when trying to resolve anything by phone. I'm a well seasoned traveler and am open minded but this place takes the piss. But hey buy cheap buy twice you get what you pay for. And up to ten days too get your bond back as they know most people using these facilities will have left the country by then, and may well find it impossible to get it back.  </value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Balmain B&amp;B at Cat and Fiddle Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>not impressed by managers lack of reply</value></title><content><value>Sent this email to the manager. Didn't even get the courtesy of a reply I recently stayed at the hotel 20/04 to 23/04 after viewing your website. Please refer to the attached photos that I perceived would be our accommodation. The room that I was alloted had two single beds and</value><value> a small seating area. I told the receptionist that the website showed rooms with couches in them and queen size beds.  I was told that there was one room left but I would have to pay $50 extra per night. I asked if it had a double bed and was told that the room had a king bed. I assumed  it would be as per the room that was on the website.  The girl I spoke to, Karina, said the manager had ducked out but as we were expected at a family members house we had to leave so I paid the extra $150 for the 3 nights and Karina kindly offered to transfer our bags. When we got back we found the room to be smaller than the room we were alloted and had two single beds shoved together. I could have done that in the room that we were originally given and had more space! It had a shared porch with a smoker from the other room. The air conditioner was so loud we had to leave it off. There were no toiletries as shown on the website. I'm not petty about that sort of thing but as we had flown down I did not bring my own due to baggage allowance. In the kitchen there was literally no bench space whatsoever to make our breakfast. Obviously people are bringing glasses up from downstairs because the sink cupboard and benches are full of glasses. I had to clear the dishrack to wash plates and put them on the dryer and struggled to find space to put the dishes away.  I do not think I should have been charged the extra $150 as the accomodation was less than what I was initially given. The way the website presents the rooms look great but that is what invites people to stay so that is the standard they should be presented.  I read the poor reviews but I often find these to be sour grapes and its not fair on the accommodation provider not to be given the opportunity to rectify the grievances which I am doing now. I hope you can understand my viewpoint and would appreciate a refund to my master card.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

The staff member took my bags and showed me to my</value><value> room, which I thought was quite nice.   I stayed in the Writing Room for 2 nights. The room itself was very comfortable and pleasant. Heater worked well, comfy bed and fluffy pillows. I was however disappointed in the communal kitchen area (one of the main reasons for booking here). The bread had mould on it and the mugs, cutlery and plates were dirty. I ended up cleaning a mug and using the milk (in date) to make a coffee. I was hoping to save money on my stay by eating sandwiches/ toast. It is a great concept but needs to be run better and stocked more regularly.   My room was noisy at night (to be expected as it is on a Main Street) and the window rattled in the wind. I can fall asleep easily, but I must admit the intermittent noise made sleep difficult. Headphones and earplugs helped with this. The second night I did manage to sleep, but probably because of the lack of sleep I got the night before.   I would stay again but would be interested to see how noise levels are in other rooms, and would love the shared kitchen to be better stocked and regularly checked on. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

The bathrooms needed a massive clean to get rid of the mould and getting rid of the spider webs with the dead spiders still hanging would have been a start. Lots of noise throughout the night made for a broken sleep. My recommendation is to stay across the road at novotel. At least those patrons look happy and refreshed.

<item><hotel_name><value>The Crest Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>A knockin shop!</value></title><content><value>The Crest is inexpensive compared to most Sydney hotels and you'll soon see why: it's located in the heart of King's Cross, the red-light district.  True the area is more unsavoury than dangerous but criminality is usually comcomitant with these types of locales.  They also</value><value> suffer from neglect by the municipal authorities e.g. the state of the footpaths was lamentable in King's Cross.  The street the hotel is on can be noisy and chaotic at night, my sleep was frequently interrupted.  This can be countered by earplugs, what a shame the smell of must in the room couldn't so easily be cancelled out.  I found reception staff to be rude and unhelpful and breakfast was below average although there is a nice cafe called 'The Fountain' just up the road and the 'Bourbon Hotel' is good for food too.  Despite the apparent slew of 'entertainment' options in the area, there actually isn't any decent bar to drink in and we often resorted to bringing off-licence to our room or better still, frequenting cool bars in the Rocks and Harbour Districts.  There is a bus that goes from King's Cross down the the Harbour but it can be time consuming during daytime traffic.

<item><hotel_name><value>The Crest Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Crest Hotel - Cheap and Reasonable</value></title><content><value>The Crest Hotel was a good comfortable place to stay. If you are a budget traveller and you want a SAFE place to stay, this is a place I would recommend. Its in Kings Cross which is in a red light district, but the GOOD side to this is the food. THe food is amazing on</value><value> Darlinghurst Street. You can get pizza, kebabs, indian food, thai, malaysian, chinese - you  name it. And very cheap prices! Best of all, they are open all night. The street has peddlers who ask for money and you might see some red light workers on the streets in the early hours of the morning or late at night but having stayed here twice I had no problems.   The views were incredible, the bed although it was old was comfortable and clean. The sheets were clean. I took off the main cover. The bathroom was clean. It came with a table and a basic tv, an alarm clock that worked (this is very important).   Overall, for 80 dollars or so and for its central location close to Elizabeth bay and the harbour views to the opera house I would have to say I was satisfied. What more could you ask for on such a cheap price? Seriously you get what you  pay for and a little extra here. IF you can handle the fact that the hotel is old 70's style hotel and needs a renovation then you will be most pleased.   Sydney hotels this close to the harbour dont come cheap, and I guarantee you that no place, no matter hoe expensive does not come with the range and diversity of food choices as this place. Take a step out of the hotel and you will be amazed. For $10 dollars I got 2 curries, 2 tandoori chickens and 2 slices of pizza.  You go anywhere else and you will pay almost $20 dollars for that. Also the hotel is within walking distance of the botanical gardens. I stayed at Manly once, and it required a ferry and a bus and cost me almost 50 dollars return.   With regards to safety in Kings Cross - this is my advice for you. The only way you might get into problems is if you actively look for this kind of thing. If you walk down the street  at a brisk pace and dont stop like I did, you can avoid any troubles.  Hopefully some people out there will be agreeing with me. As with anything - you get what you pay for - THIS PLACE - you get what you pay for and extra.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

Although, I have stayed for 4 months and wouldn`t recommend with a five-star rating, because the housekeepers are VERY rude with the students (it seems that they can`t stand working there anymore), they ask for a "bond" when you check in (in case you broke anything) and don't refund you as promised in contract, and they also WAKE YOU UP VERY EARLY shouting out loud and knocking the door because they have to clean it.

<item><hotel_name><value>Sugar Shack</value></hotel_name><title><value>Hated the way they treated us!!! AVOID</value></title><content><value>I booked our double via the Boomerang website. They confirmed everything in an e-mail. There was NO notice that their reception is not open in the evening. We mentioned, that our plane would arrive late and if it's any problem. No, of course not, said someone (still have this</value><value> mail), only it wouldn't be possible to pick us up from the airport. He asked to come to the Ambassador and give them a call when at the doors.  Imagine 11 pm, heavy rain that evening and us handling our heavy bags from the train to the very doors of the ambassador (nice steep stairs, by the way...). Imagine calling them and hearing a really RUDE guy telling us they have no doubles since we'd arrived TOO LATE. I tried to explain everything, but he wouldn't listen, finishing this quite a long call with "it's only your problem".  Luckily two guests opened the door for us and let us in. They said the receptionist lived in this hostel and that she would arrive in a minute. We waited and happened to ask one couple if they'd seen a receptionist. They started to ask us about the problem and said that they had EXACTLY the same case when they'd arrived in Syd.  In the morning we came to the reception to check in and met another girl who confirmed having the same problems last night.  The room was so dirty that I barely wanted to touch anything. Compared to other Aussie hostels we'd stayed in before, it was a disaster. It was enough for me just to look under the bed. The reception stinks because there was a very dirty rubbish bin. Every day the girls do the cleaning but I think that the hostel is too big for them to clean it properly. According to the opinion of guys we met there, who stayed one night in the Boomerang (same owner), that one is even worse.  A little advice - if you still decide to book a room there, try not to get the room with a view on the Darlinghurst Road. Terribly loud until 7 am.  It's definitely not worth spending your money there. Their boss doesn't know anything about client service or simple good behaviour rules, he did everything to make me write this not really good review.

When we</value><value> arrived there was no double for us - girl at the reception said that it was the boss, who answered our call but there were no rooms already... It was already late but we called another backpackers: "Boomerang Backpackers" and man's voice said: yes, we have double, please come - look how lukcy were we! (evening, in other hostels there were no doubles but here one call and it is). So we went with our heavy luggage to "Boomerang Backpackers" and the same situation as in "AAA Ambassador" - she said it was the BOSS who answered our call!!!! And I asked if the boss is responsible also for the "AAA Ambassador" - she said YES! He was previously in AAA Ambassador, then he moved to Boomerang and twice we had this bad luck to talk with him on phone.  Look - two hostels, quite few minutes of walk from one to another (try to do that in a hot evening with heavy luggage and then very upstairs (Boomerang) and you will see what I mean.  My personal feeling: The guy (boss, manager, whatever) responsible for "AAA Ambassador" and "Boomerang Backpackers" played with us twice the same game: 1. Confirmed by phone our booking  2. When we arrived he was not there, but there was also no booking (only receptionist who did not feel very sorry and proposed us a dorm)  Avoid! Avoid! Avoid! as they are not worth of leaving there your money!   There in Sydney are really many more NICER and PROFESSIONALLY managed hostels than "AAA Ambassador" and "Boomerang Backpackers"!

However,</value><value> later on in the year I discovered some really bad reviews on booking.com for these apartments and it was then I started to have some concerns about our choice of accommodation. We were due to arrive on the 3.1.10. On Christmas Day, I received a phone call from the Manager asking if we wanted to stay at the Hilton instead! I thought they must have over booked, I declined the offer, as the Hilton had no self catering option. I was assured everything was ok, and that he would put us in an apartment on the 35th floor. A couple of days before we left, I had an email saying we would have to stay in another apartment across the road for 1 night, then move to our apartment the next day. i rang, and said I did not want this and was assured it was ok, that we could spend the 6 nights at the Apartment Deluxe Sydney Central. The day before we left, I had another phone call from the Manager saying he was very sorry but we would have to stay at the other apartment for 1 night. I finally got the truth out of him, the apartment had a burst water pipe and it still wasn't repaired yet, the carpets were wet, etc etc. I was horrified and  couldn't believe how he had deceived us. I demanded a refund if I could find alternate accommodation. He agreed to that thank goodness, so after a mad search on the internet, I found accommodation as we were running out the door to catch our flight. It ended up costing us an extra $300, but I am very glad that we did not stay at these apartments. BEWARE!!!!!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

Also, my room was on the first floor so I could hear the noise from the street, but hey I'm not there for a five-star accommodation. I was just in my room mostly to sleep at night and be out the whole day. They had incredibly hot showers which is a big plus for me. I never ran out of hot water for showers.

Once inside we realized how good the photographer was. This was indeed the same place but it looked 20 years older and much dirtier. There was a dead fly on the window and a dead cockroach in the kitchen. The sheets were stained and the bathroom looked terrible. The "view" is just looking onto a regular street.

<item><hotel_name><value>Annandale Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Average. Wouldn't stay more than a few days.</value></title><content><value>I booked a private double room with an ensuite. It's rather small, and I was travelling with one other person - which made it difficult. If I were to book again, two seperate rooms might be better.  It was alright for staying 2 nights (3 days), but I wouldn't want to stay more</value><value> than that. We stayed on a Thursday and Friday night, and it was LOUD downstairs, however this IS a live music venue and pub, not a standard hotel.  All I needed was a place to keep my belongings for a few days, and to sleep, and I got that - paid a bit much for it, but I got it.  When you are led into the guest side entrance to access your room, it looks rather dirty, pulled up carpet and leaves and dirt all over. Upstairs (I was in room number 2) in our room, there are several things to point out.  1. The windows open, didn't lock, and have no fly screen. If you want them open, you'd have to be there and hope nothing flies or crawls in. 2. The curtains are VERY sheer, almost pointless in having them. 3. The fan was almost covered in dust, which meant we would have to clean it if we wanted to turn it on instead of having the windows open - which made staying cool and issue. 4. There was a room clock, batteries didn't work. 5. The roof was peeling away from the plaster, who knows what was hiding in there? 6. Sheets had a few holes in them, and side table looked as though it had contact over it that had creased. 7. In the bathroom, the shower doesn't have anything on the ground to stop the water from flowing out onto the bathroom tiles. There is a drain, however it sits flat and is not sunken in to help drain water. Which means super short showers unless you wanted a flooded bathroom. Also on the topic of the bathroom - there was no bin, which made being a female a little difficult. 8. It's a SMALL double bed.  Food downstairs is really good! Burgers By Josh have taken over, so if you don't like burgers, you may be out of luck, as they didn't seem to promote having any other kind of food. However the burger was delicious, and it comes with fries (the menu doesn't say so, so I ordered seperate fries and nobody bothered to tell me it came with the burger anyway)  Seems to be only accessible by stairs, so if you are injured, pregnant or otherwise cannot use stairs - this might not be the place for you.   Across the road is a McDonalds (Parramatta road) and across the side road (where the guest entrance is) there is a small cafe with very nice coffee, which was beneficial.  Did not use the communal kitchen or bathrooms, so cannot comment on the matter.   Room had a small double bed, two bedside tables, one lamp, one desk, one chair, one cupboard, one power outlet (near the bedside table and lamp), shower, sink, toilet.  Poor view from the room I was in, in saying that, traffic noise was not an issue, the only noise issue for us was music, however we willingly stayed in a music venue on a Thursday and Friday night - so we expected this.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

Free breakfast was like feeding time at the zoo and there wasn’t enough space to sit and eat indoors as it was raining outside.   If you’re working or long term stayer then I suggest staying elsewhere with a bigger kitchen and a more comfortable living.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>The Village Broadway</value></hotel_name><title><value>DO NOT STAY HERE! Awful management.</value></title><content><value>I’ve been staying at this hostel on and off for a while, everything used to be fine until the management changed recently. Now the new manager (Laura) has changed the reception opening hours to 11;00-14:30 so it is now impossible to extend if you work normal hours, and to top it</value><value> off you will get charged a late fee due to this. Laura has also decided to change the kitchen opening hours to 7am knowing full well that a lot of the tenants here work in construction and need to be able to access the kitchen to grab their lunches etc for the day ahead. The bathrooms absolutely stink and even after multiple complaints off most people staying here the manager refuses to listen, for example there was a leak coming from the roof in one of the rooms the other day, it took 2 days for her to even get anyone round to fix it and meanwhile the person staying in this room had to wake up to her bed/belongings being leaked on. There are some major health and safety concerns that also never get addressed, for example the boxes to store your luggage in, there’s big metal strips hanging off, there was a hole in the doorway downstairs directly as you enter that didn’t get fixed for 4 WHOLE DAYS, somebody hurt themselves by falling through it due to it not getting fixed and still the lack of care from management was unbelievable. be prepared to get kept up past 3am in the morning due to the bar downstairs, again this could be forgivable if they at least had an area for guests to chill and relax, but no they decide to kick everyone out of this space at 10:30pm!! To make all this better the manager struggles to even spell basic English when putting up passive aggressive signs around the place?! And as a result to all these issues, it’s the general receptionist staff that have to deal with all these problems, whilst they are the ONLY thing holding this place together! DO NOT BOTHER TO STAY, you can find plenty of other hostels where the management will at least listen to your issues.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

I booked a double bed room and it came with an en-suite. There is enough room to move around with ease as well as a massive fan which definatly keeps me cool at night.   If you have a pc</value><value> there is a desk as well as an Ethernet port to plug in directly to the internet. The internet at the time of 22:36 on January the 6th has an download of 8.04 MB/S and an upload of 10.8 MB/S and a PING of 2ms. So in my opinion a winner winner chicken dinner internet speed.   The room design wise is not a modern room so dont expect your booking a five star hotel. The En suit is very roomy which is nice for such a cheap place.   There is a court yard to relax in which is beautiful during the day. There is a tv room with sky and a mini kitchen with a microwave as well as a laundry room which is very cheap at only 2 dollars a wash.

<item><hotel_name><value>Sydney Space</value></hotel_name><title><value>Stay anywhere else!</value></title><content><value>I don’t usually write reviews but I had to as this place was so foul! We stayed here 5 nights and it was awful. Keep in mind we are both in our 20’s and don’t mind basic accomodation. The pictures on booking.com do not accurately convey the student accomodation. Here is how the</value><value> following was;  Room: my partner and I got a double room, there was no air con but a large electric fan in the room. It was so noisy but we needed it on in the night because of the humidity! It was dusty and made you feel sick in the mornings. The sheets in our room were not changed over the 5 nights nor was our towels, we had to ask for new ones. I’ve been to hostels before and they usually change (and clean) the room every 3 days. In January heat, these things need changing!  Bathroom: *shudder*.  This was by far the worst thing about our stay. We were on the second floor so we had to use a unisex bathroom. It was really old, smelled of urine. The bathrooms were not cleaned consistently or well and were mostly in a disgusting state. I know people should tidy up after themselves but it’s not always the case so they need to be checked. The showers made me want to vomit with razors, boxers, hair and empty shampoo bottles left in the stalls. It was gross and left my skin crawling! There was a small, newer bathroom down the hall, slightly better but still dirty. They need to be renovated.  Kitchen; we bought some food to have our breakfast here to reduce the cost of our trip but ended up eating 5 out of 6 days. The oven was broken, the hob didn’t work, there was no toaster (basic!), no cups and limited cutlery. Very poor.   As we stayed in the old part of the building we were not told there was no elevator so keep in mind if you have 2 x 30kgs bags from travel!  On checking out, the guy at reception was too busy talking to someone else that they didn’t ask how our stay was or did we need a taxi booked or even have a good day. Basic customer service is lacking with some (not all) staff.  Basically for the money you pay, I would recommend to stay literally anywhere else!its disgraceful that they charge travelers this money to live in bad conditions. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Manly Beach House</value></hotel_name><title><value>In Excellent Condition Now</value></title><content><value>To be honest, I read the previous reviews about this place and was very concerned about my choice of accommodation for my Sydney trip.

When we arrived, we were greeted by a very friendly Cristina who is the manager.  Our room was spotlessly clean as was the ensuite bathroom.  Other people staying here were also very friendly and always said hello to us.  They were also respectful of the house rules and always cleaned up after themselves and kept noise to a minimum.  This place also has a nice outdoor area with a BBQ for guests to use and enjoy. It is also close to the bus stops (literally diagonally opposite) so you can take the very frequent buses to Manly Wharf or Warringah Mall in the opposite direction for Westfield shopping.  Driving around in your own vehicle is also not a problem in the area.  Or if you wanted to you could walk to the Wharf or Manly Beach from here.

<item><hotel_name><value>Manly Beach House</value></hotel_name><title><value>Expensive hostel type accommodation with a grubby feel</value></title><content><value>I’ve stayed in many hostel type accommodations but none quite so grim as this. This is a lovely house, lovely features of a fitted kitchen, leather sofas in the lounge, tiled floors, tiled bathroom HOWEVER it would be hard to say when it was all last cleaned. Our room had mouldy</value><value> bedding, damp on the wall, dirt and coffee rings on the window sill, old soap remnants in the shower, dirty shower, grubby toilet, sticky tables.   The kitchen was disorganised, no washing up liquid, no tea towels, no cleaning cloths so people were not cleaning up after themselves. There was milk in the fridge with a use by date of 3 weeks prior to our arrival. The fridges were a health hazard with ‘stuff’ dripping and pooling to the bottom. There was food rotting and breaking down in bags. They had clearly not been cleaned out for weeks. The owner said we were welcome to make a cup of tea or coffee “if we could find a clean cup!!!”. There were none.   The laundry was piling up by the washing machine; don’t know whether it was guests washing or the hostels, but for $4 to use, it had to be emptied prior to being able to use!   A lovely outdoor area was untidy And when we went out for breakfast we found the table to be filthy with the remnants of the previous nights party with fag ends burnt into the seat cushions.  The WiFi signal was poor and we could not get access. We did not pursue this. The TV in the lounge was on morning noon and night. The area was not a communal area because of that.   The owner apologised for it being a mess and suggested that guests could not read the notices that said “Clean up after you or be charged a $20 Fee”. No body was cleaning up. Nobody. Within 5 minutes of being there we had filled the garbage bin (which wasn’t emptied) and used a shower spray and toilet paper to clean the work surface and to clean some mugs.   We paid about $125 for one night here and I have paid less in better places. It was not value for money. I booked it through Airbnb. This is not a room in someone’s home. It is not a Guest House.   I do not normally write reviews like this, but I was let down on this property. I don’t mind old furniture, a cobweb or faded paint, but what I do object to is a dirty room and kitchen. I usually take reviews with a pinch of salt as the pictures don’t normally depict the reality.   I submitted a review of the place on Airbnb but the owner did not mutually respond or allow for the review to be published. For somewhere so popular, it was half empty at Easter and there a only a handful of reviews.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Gazebo Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Pre-wedding dinner for 14</value></title><content><value>I think some establishments might shudder at the the thought of a 'hens night' group turning up on a Saturday night. Our group was welcomed with open arms by the lovely friendly staff at the Gazebo Wine Bar. To be fair, however, we were a quiet group with none of the silliness</value><value> that can sometimes go hand in hand with hens nights.  The decor was modern with a chandelier overhanging the room. There are bench seats, small tables with stools and long tables for larger groups. The room is curved and this makes for the possibility of finding  a more private nook for a quiet conversation.   There is outside seating also, with gas heaters and blankets for cooler nights.  We did wait for almost two hours for our food, which was a little too long. Despite the wait we enjoyed ourselves and when it did arrive it was beautifully prepared and very tasty. We had a set menu for $55 each which was of a very high standard. It included shared entrees with vegetarian options as well as chicken liver pate, eggplant relish, ricotta and grilled bread to slather it all onto. Mains were also shared. We had chicken, a fabulous rigatoni with hazelnuts and a lovely smokey beef, beautifully tender and pink. All served with fresh salads and a delightful bean dish.  Dessert was definitely NOT for sharing - a small sliver of chocolate walnut brownie with ice cream and pistachios. Not too much and a great way to finish the meal.  A very reasonable price for a delicious 3 course meal in my opinion.  The drinks were well priced too -  I had a lychee and lime cocktail which was very enjoyable for $18 and with dinner, a glass of dry white wine for $11.    There is piped music which I found just a tad too loud for easy conversation,  but I am a woman of a certain age - the young folk in our group didn't have a problem! There is a parking station literally 20 steps from the venue so if you are driving you won't have any trouble finding a place for the car. Taxi's abound in the streets nearby also.  I did not visit the amenities but was told that they were clean and well maintained.  A lovely night was had by all.   </value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

Stayed over the</value><value> weekend during a cold spell in November, and am now counting my blessings that those were all rather cool nights, because there's no air-conditioning! On the last night, it went up to about 20degC, and I ended up sleeping with a hairdryer to scare the mosquitoes away.  We got two rooms - 1 x Double, 1 x Twin Share. Very clean; they have it professionally cleaned once a week. The bathroom was spotless except for the drainage. The Twin share was large, and my travel companions loved it. They also enjoyed interacting with the hosts. Mary J &amp; Peter are warm, friendly folks who served organic jams, and homemade mulberry jam, together with wholesome fruits, and gourmet teas. Breakfast was a lovely experience, and so was chatting with the two folks.  However, it's an old house; very quaint, with a lovely cat. Hence, do get used to a little bit of creaking, presence of many crevices, and the feeling that you're being watched. If you're used to hotels, then you might be slightly uncomfortable.

We arrived there by taxi from the airport.  Mary (owner) had kindly provided us with directions to the hotel from the airport in advance as the Sydney taxi drivers are not the best.  The B &amp; B is in a good location just</value><value> off Oxford Street which is the main Sydney to Bondi Road.  From there you can get several buses (333, 378 or 380) in to the City.    The room we had was on top floor.  No air conditioning in the room but you don't really expect it in an old house.  Thankfully a fan was provided.  As our stay was over new year the house was full.  One thing I will say is a there was only one bathroom for all guests to share, you had to be on your toes, otherwise you could wait ages to get in there and have a shower.  Both our room and the bathroom were very clean.  The TV in our room only had about 2 channels tuned in but I suppose you are on holiday and that isn't why you travel.     So overall a good stay.  Mary and Peter were nice (Mary even picked me up some Mussels from the local fish market one morning).  They were flexbible with breakfast times but they have to be with only 1 bathroom.  I thought it was a bit overpriced but most places are over the new year period.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

Fully equipped kitchen, cleaned every day. . Free laundry facilities. . Free WiFi. . Your own fridge freezer, TV and computer included in your room.  The hostel managers Una and Karen have been so helpful and friendly throughout our stay. Nothing was too much trouble for them, if we had any questions or issues they were sorted the same day.

<item><hotel_name><value>Addisons Travellers Lodge</value></hotel_name><title><value>Prefect place for backpackers wanting to work</value></title><content><value>So after reading some of the previous reviews, i decided I would write my opinion.  Reality is... come here and make your own mind up.  I am glad we did and did not listen to the previous reviews!  Before checking in we were offered a viewing of the room and building before</value><value> committing.  Staff explained the whole property very well and their 4 week minimum stay procedure for the cheaper rate.   Room had everything we needed, internet / Wifi / Tv / OWN Fridge-freezer / Aircon (which had a heat setting) / OWN bathroom and storage for some clothes.  After backpacking around Australia these are luxuries that you usually do not get in other hostels. The room was clean, yes there was rust around the mirror but it was still clean.  I guess people really do like to winge! By no means was it a 5* hotel but that's not want you pay for.  It is good bang for your buck!   The staff were more than happy to help me set up my TFN number. Informed me on opening a bank account and Medicare and even rang me when work came into the office.  We stayed here for just over 5 months and I would recommend it.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

By no means is it luxury its definitely more on the budget end, but it is a great location and it was ideal as it was only about a 30 min walk from the center and about a 10 min bus</value><value> ride. It's in Newtown which was such a quirky and cool place with loads of unique shops and almost had a Camden like vibe to it.  The accommodation itself could have been more clean and it is not the most quiet of places depending on who else is living there, but it has a nice roof terrace however it must have been fairly near an airport as it was very loud as planes flew over the site.  Some of the best memories of my life here would say its worth looking into if you have some friends you want to stay with and you are looking to save money but remain close the center of Sydney.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

This apartment is not luxury, it was comfortable enough but did not have any kitchen basics such as coffee machine, tea, coffee, sugar, oil, milk etc. Not even</value><value> a platter or cheese knife, which you would expect at a luxury apartment. There was only one tea towel, no tissues or paper towel. Also the plates did not even fit in the dishwasher meaning we had to wash the dishes ourselves. The bedrooms didn't have proper curtains, there was makeshift curtains in the back bedroom and one wall is glass tiles and the light shone in all night, my family member had to sleep on the couch the second night. Towels are supplied but no face washers. The apartment is also above a nightclub with thumping music going until 3am in the morning and they dont mention this before you book. This is defintely not worth the price tag attached to it and needs some serious maintenance and homely touches. Very very disappointed and would not book here again and do not recommend to others unless half the price. The only good things about this apartment were the views out to the beach and the beds were comfy.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

The second bedroom is more enclosed but still with an ensuite and the third is in the back with ensuite and laundry attached.  Entry through the back alley was not an issue and checking in/out was done remotely. Free WiFi was good and all facilities functioned well.  A really solid bit of holiday accommodation.  The fact that workmen started drilling into the concrete structure of the building at 7am on a Friday morning adjoining a long weekend holiday was not the fault of the owners/managers. Very modern.

It is located 7 minutes from the King Cross Station which is convenient as it is 2 stations away from Bondi Junction and Town Hall which is mainly the shopping area.  I took the airport shuttle from the airport (AUD$12 per person) and took us 30-40mins.  Overall, I would recommend this place for budget conscious people like me and just a place to sleep comfortably.  The previous week I had also stayed in Westin Sydney which was more expensive and the expectation is different when you are paying half the rate you are paying there.

<item><hotel_name><value>Sydney The Pullman Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Dated hotel, poor customer service, wouldn’t stay here again</value></title><content><value>Stayed here for just 1 night in March 2019. Overall, hotel feels dated. We had a standard double room; facilities were relatively basic. Bathroom decor in particular was dated and felt quite old - some chipped tiles and mould spotted too. In-room facilities were all-round basic;</value><value> nothing special... or 5-star!   Only positive was the location: incredibly central and easy access to the whole of central Sydney.   We were in a room just behind the elevator shafts and every time the elevators operated, there was an almighty metallic rumbling sound through the wall. All through the night. I had possibly the worst night’s sleep I’ve ever had in a hotel.   I complained to the front desk in the evening and asked to move rooms. The lady told me she was aware that there is a problem with the elevators and the problem was being rectified - and simply offered me a bottle of wine as an apology, as the only rooms they could move us to were also behind the elevator shafts....coincidence!? So we had to just lump it. I also requested ear plugs - but they never arrived.   Then, as we checked out, I raised it again as an issue (as it was a different person) - including my poor night’s sleep and, again, was simply offered a bottle of wine as an apology. The manager didn’t even come out in person to speak to me, which I thought was quite unacceptable.   All in - not a 5-star experience, and not worth the £200 a night I paid. Absolutely wouldn’t stay here again.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

This was made known to us earlier but we still missed the entrance as had only been sent a photo of the main gate rather than the building. The building is a really old one and the facilities pool gym are not well maintained (lots of debris in pool) so we didn’t use them at all. Coin Laundromat close at 9.30pm so make sure u plan your washing. Also it will only take $1 or $0.20 coins and no other denominations (ended up having to walk to nearby minimart to get change). Apartment 118  was adequately sized and kitchenette equipped for light cooking. However cleaning not done properly so much stuff were left greasy and had to be rewashed before we could use it. Induction cooker did not come with instructions so had to seek help from passing neighbor. Hosts were very responsive and helpful. Lots of large bottles of kitchen cleaning and bathroom amenities for guests. The sofa bed was threadbare but still managed to get some rest on it.

Only comment is that the marketing gurus who chose expressions like "waterside" and "waterfront" had clearly never visited the site as they are definitely not.   Would advise not staying in a studio there if you want the use of 2 beds and living area at the same time, the apartment was simply not big enough for this. As a last minute booking for us however it was ideal, cheap and value for money.   Main bed was good, the sofa was not particularly comfortable, and having a kitchenette and decent bathroom was all we needed. Car parking is available if you need it.

Luxurious bed linens and towels (an ample supply !)</value><value> Lots of storage space and many unexpected extras including: a really excellent blow dryer, a complete sewing kit, beach towels, picnic basket, first aid kit, TV, DVD player, dishwasher, etc. The apartment boasts two terraces, each running the full length of the apartment.

Both terraces are very comfortably furnished with comfortable couches and chairs, and we enjoyed relaxing on the terraces after a full day's sightseeing in Sydney. Robert, our host, was simply terrific: Available when we needed his help and very friendly, yet completely unobtrusive.

The Darlinghurst location is excellent for visitors to Sydney: centrally located, yet very quiet at night.

The location is easy to find, and has a myriad of cool, hip restaurants and bars in a safe and short walking distance from the apartment. Try Bills or  The Bunker literally a block away for breakfast and if you want a real cutie try Chez Dee in the back roads off Kings Cross about 10 minute walk. Dinner, we did Buffalo on the first night which is a little restaurant on the same little road as the apartment. We then tried the very hip and newly opened Monopole on Potts Points - about a 15 minute walk. Even the little Indian on Victoria Road towards Kingscross for a quick Sunday night fix was one of the best I have been to around world. The hosting was warm, courteous - but like most jaded travelers I loved it because after the initial welcome and show around - they just left us to our own devices for the next 3 days. Just a quiet text mid way to check all OK. LOVED IT! Cannot recommend this highly enough if you are like me, love the boutique experience but want total professionalism and privacy with it. Oh and if you are a walker like us, you can walk into the city via Potts Point and the Botanic Gardens and stop off at Wooloomooloo wharf for a little sustenance on the way back or head down Potts Point and over to Rushcutters Bay via the little walkways through the apartment buildings - quite easy to find. One little cafe we found was towards Rushcutters Bay and literally on the little private water taxi wharf was this cool coffee shop. Instead of sitting table side, I sat on the wharf steps with my coffee - feet in the Sydney waters, gorgeous on a typical Sydney summers day and not a cloud in the sky. Will be back!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

I'll try to keep things factual and let you make your own judgements. I attended on a Thursday night recently. It wasn't that busy in the grand scheme of things. I ordered dinner at 18.10 along with a drink. Bar</value><value> staff were pleasant and courteous. At 18.50 , still waiting but one of the waiting staff picked up things were amiss and said he would check. 18. 55 I was advised that my dinner was being put through and I was offered an apology.  At 19.00 my food arrived again with an apology.  I was attending sporting event, and this was evident by the way I was dressed and missed  a portion of the game as a result. I thank the young man who picked up things were not right as without his intuition I would clearly not have been fed. I note the bar had a nice selection to choose from and my white rabbit dark on tap was cool and refreshing. The food was ok, but not worth a 50 minute wait when I clearly had to be somewhere. My suggestion is that you can go there for a drink quite comfortably, but go elsewhere for dinner first.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Pensione Italia Bed &amp; Breakfast</value></hotel_name><title><value>A bit delusional</value></title><content><value>We travelled half way around the world to attend a wine festival.  This place was chosen for us because our friends live in the area.  Ok, it is cheaper than places in Sydney, but way too expensive, according to Italian and USA  standards for what was offered.    Welcome:  As</value><value> soon as we arrived, Sig. Alfio asked us for  a downpayment.  We were staying for 10 nights and had just arrived from the airport. We asked if we could give him our credit card.  They don't take credit cards, nor Euro cash. Just Australian dollar cash. He was quick to point out that on the street parallel were several banks and we'd have no problem cashing in our Euros the next morning.   Breakfast:  We asked where the breakfast area was and he said the stuff for breakfast was in the room.  That fact already is more like  a "rent a room" than a B&amp;B. There were items in the room - instant Nescafe, white bread, processed cheese, and water left in the water boiler.  If people are satisfied with those items, then the room does contain breakfast supplies.   Payment:  The following day we asked Alfio for bank details, as we were not going to pay in cash Australian dollars -160 per night for 10 nights (more than 1000 Euro).  They gave us their bank account and insisted that a money transfer was possible without a Swift code. It was our bank in Europe that did the  research to find their Swift code.  After our bank asked them to verify it, the money was sent. In the mean time, he was worried that we wouldn't pay and asked everyday for the money.   The room:  We were two friends and the bed was a place and a half. It would be good for a couple but he knew well in advance we were not a couple.  The room is without a window.  The only window for the bedroom was  a small one in the bathroom above the shower area.  Check out:  At 10.27 on our checkout day Sig. Alfio arrives to ask when we are leaving as he needed to clean - - - for no new guests.  Since our flight, is  at 7:45 pm we asked if we could go out for an early lunch , come back and prepare to leave.  Ok,said Alfio.  however when we arrived the towels were gone, sheets already off the bed and cleaning in motion.  He also took the bootle of water i purchased earlier that morning for my long stay at the airport.  Our colleague also stayed 8 nights at Pension Italia. I would think that paying a total of 18 nights, he could have let us stay a bit longer.   Maria, his wife  is nicer and more welcoming.   Wifi:  Wifi was free and sometimes worked better than others. mostly it was very slow or non existent.   Neighborhood:  The neighborhood was nice and it was easy to get into the heart of Sydney - bus 438. There were nice restaurants and shops on Norton street, one block away. The best coffee in town was just down the street at a cute and cozy shop called Cafein Bar. They served great breakfasts and lunches as well.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

The films I want to see don't start till 8:45pm &amp; 9:30pm so I didn't want to drive back and forth to Wollongong. I found this little place, only $70 a night, right around the corner from Norton Street. It even has parking out the back for</value><value> no extra charge! Breakfast supplies are in the kitchen but I preferred to frequent local cafes - I recommend Carousel on Flood St. And for dinner a bowl of pasta and gelato at Bar Italia on Norton St. The shared toilet and shower are right next to my room number 3. The room is old fashioned but spacious with a double bed &amp; single bed, chairs , wardrobe, dresser, mirror , fan, heater, bedside tables&amp; lamps. Come &amp; go as you please through the gated driveway. There is a restaurant next door which can be noisy but it didn't bother me that much. A great find! I'll be back!

Having said that, you can't beat the price at just $70 a night for a large, comfortable room with double and single bed and shared bathroom. The bathroom was quite small but</value><value> sufficient with a good shower and small vanity. The shared kitchen was well equipped with continental breakfast items and the fridge was well stocked with milk, bread and fruit. The location is great - just a five minute stroll to leichhardt's wonderful cafés and restaurants and to bus stops which have a direct route into the city (about 25/30 mins). The decor is very dated (70's look)and there is no television in the room. There is one in the shared kitchen though. I would happily stay here again although I might pay the bit extra for an ensuited room. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Bellevue Terrace B&amp;B</value></hotel_name><title><value>MORE OF A HOSTEL THAN A B&amp;B</value></title><content><value>For what I paid for this accommodation it is certainly not worth it!  On first impressions, we pulled up outside after a long tiring journey to very messy courtyard, looked as if it hadn't been swept for a long time. The house itself was behind grills, even the door and on</value><value> knocking the door, we were met by a bewildered looking man who after stating we had a booking, still looked somewhat bewildered!!  On entry we were asked to remove our shoes, we were all very happy to oblige as we thought the carpets and furnishings must be all new and clean.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  The property needs a good clean and if possible, total refurbishment of all the rooms. The furnishings are antiques, especially the appliances, my gran had appliances like these when I was a young girl!! The suite in the lounge area is ancient (and dirty).There is only one bathroom to be shared amongst three guest rooms, not ideal if you are only booking one room. Luckily we booked all three so we shared the toilet facilities with family.  The breakfast, which you had to do yourself comprised of fresh fruit, cereal, one large tub of yogurt, orange juice, two loaves of bread, eight slices of bacon, eggs and jars of nutella and peanut butter (both of which had been opened previously) this had to last us five mornings and was never replenished, once it was gone - tough!! Twice during our stay we had visitors in the kitchen (cockroaches) - not a good selling point! The bedrooms were full of dust gathering nic nacs which were full of - yip - dust!  The beds and bedding were lovely - that was the only saving grace of this accommodation.  It cost us $2400 for five nights for three rooms - rip off!!  On top of the ridiculous price was the ridiculous 'House Rules' a copy of which was left in each guest room. I'm not going to detail each and every rule as there were far too many, but as myself and my family are all professional people I do not expect to be told I can't leave a cup on the draining board, it must be dried and put away, dishes not to be left in the dishwasher, food not to be taken further than the dining room etc etc etc.  As my heading suggests, this is more of a hostel than a B&amp;B or any other sort of lodging! Oh and not forgetting the parking - there is none - you can only park outside on the street during certain times or feed a meter all your money or you will get fined. There is no permit as offered in the listing.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Bellevue Terrace B&amp;B</value></hotel_name><title><value>Comfortable but not friendly</value></title><content><value>We were ( just ) inside the front door when we were told to take our shoes off and close both doors, certainly no please or a smile. We had a car so had to ask several times about the parking arrangements, on one of the web sites it says free parking. We paid $10 and were given</value><value> the permit. The room was very pleasant and clean as was the bathroom although I would not like to be there if the other two rooms were let. We were shown the kitchen and given instructions for breakfast and told to put dishes in the dishwasher and leave things the way we found them, we had expected to be served our breakfast, as I said not a friendly attitude. We didn't see Heather other than on our arrival. Having stayed at other B&amp;Bs with lovely friendly hosts, we were disappointed. Robin</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>'The 150 Apartments' by Apartment Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Our favorite place to stay in Sydney - GREAT location &amp; facilities</value></title><content><value>This place isn't cheap but if you're staying in Sydney for close to a week or more, it becomes a lot more cost effective.  What you get for your money is so much more than you'd ever get at a hotel.  We stayed in unit 805 which is a two bedroom, two bathroom, two story very</value><value> modern apartment.  It had a full kitchen, full living room, a beautiful master bath with a 5 person shower (no kidding!), and generous second bathroom with a tub, and two nicely sized bedrooms.  Pleasant surprises were: a full sized office area that comfortably allowed my partner and I to both work when necessary, free EXCELLENT wi-fi with good reliability and speeds, balconies on BOTH sides of the apartment (The living room opens to a full balcony while the master bedroom side opens to a partially enclosed balcony).  The glass on the street side was all double paned and despite what prior reviewers stated, we didn't hear any noise at all.  There are blinds on all windows however I agree that the living room (and the second bedroom which is a loft over the living room) become very bright early in the morning no matter what you do with the shades.  The master bedroom has metal shutters that effectively keep out light (and noise).  Coffee, tea, sugar, designer toiletries, etc, are all included.  Reservations and check in were flawless.  We never had to meet a person and arrival can happen anytime because the keys are simply left for you in a key lock box.  The location is perfect right on Oxford Street and Hyde Park with easy 1 block walk to the subway.  We would stay here again in an instant and feel that its higher cost (compared with hotels) is far outweighed by the size, quality, and location.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

Towels fluffy and clean. Overall I can’t and wouldn’t fault the room, people , location and price.    It’s a credit to the owner that a standard has clearly been set - and maintained.

We got a week of free parking - so parked the car and went on foot everywhere - cause everything is walking distance. A few trips to Coles for supplies can save you a lot of $$. A lovely bakery practically at the front door is a must, as well as the weekend Manly market. Was it noisey? Yes, it was on New Years Eve, but we did sleep with our windows open, the rest of the week was fine with us getting some good sleep Zzzz's in the bank :) Apartment size is perfect for couples, a squeeze with children but we weren't there to sit around the room - we were off on a Sydney adventure, and that we did in one of the best locations on offer - Manly - beach on one side, harbour the other - just perfect.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

The shared bathrooms on each level while old style were clean, the water was hot, and had decent pressure.   For a short term stay and only using the room to sleep the Keg and Brew is a great place.   The location is ideal for Sydney. A few minutes walk to Central Station. A Tab, chemist, supermarket, and a variety of eateries all in walking distance makes the Keg and Brew a great place for a short stay for a boys/girls weekend away.

I had a few reasons to complain, firstly I was over paying for my room (by 70 odd dollars) 'because I booked it early' compared to other people</value><value> getting the exact same room. I Understand New Year's Eve and New Year's Day would be expensive, and I have no qualms with that at all. After all, that is the two nights I wanted to book and the reason I was in Syndey. But to stay on those days I HAD to book 5 nights at the extortionate price even though after the 2nd the price went right down as these are just see as 'any' night now the nye celebrations were over. That said, I was still paying more than 70$per night extra (110$ per night In total) for a  bunk bed in the exact same room others were paying as low as 30$. I know this becuase I spoke with my room mates and couldn't believe it. I went to speak with the manager named Bruce and he just spoke down to me as If I was stupid. I felt absolutely robbed, especially because the 'deluxe' room had absolutely no circulation, smelt bad and was hotter than a sauna. The shower was hot and cold; hardly deluxe. And if that wasn't enough, my food was stolen from the fridge. Easily one of the worst places I've stayed in the entirety of my 6 months trip. Absolute rip off.

<item><hotel_name><value>The Outback Lodge</value></hotel_name><title><value>Great location, awful service!</value></title><content><value>My fiance and I stayed here for 3 nights as it is reasonably priced for Manly and in a great location near the beach. Everywhere else we have stayed in Aus we received a friendly reception and great customer service. Here is not the case! A man greeted us who instantly looked</value><value> like he was annoyed by our presence, hardly said a word, showed us to our room in haste and then practically ran out before we could ask any questions.  I noticed that the cleanliness was poor, particularly in the bathroom where there was hair and dirt on the floor. There were also marks on the sheets and the cups and plates and cupboards were not clean. The shower (which was tiny) had a door that did not slide properly and we could not close. We paid for an executive apartment so this was not acceptable. Upon mentioning this to the same man the next morning, he stormed off to our room with me practically running behind him, went straight to the bathroom and "fixed" the door after an evident struggle. He then had the audacity to tell me I had to be careful with it rather than apologising for it! He then looked at the floor and said he couldn't see what I meant about the dirt. I literally moved it with my sandal in front of him. He said the tiles are old so look dirty??? Then stormed out again without another word.  If you want to stay somewhere with appalling customer service where you're made to feel a nuisance for even being alive, stay here.   Such a shame as it was a lovely style of room (if only it was properly cleaned) and in a great location. But people should not be running the place who clearly hate dealing with customers.

Do not stay here!</value></title><content><value>Upon arrival I was told that they did not want our booking (because of my 2yo and 1yo babies) but that they were forced to honor the booking by the booking site. They made a point of explaining that my kids would annoy the other guests so we ended up walking on egg shells. Then</value><value> they did not give us the room as selected (and paid for on the app) but a smaller one with less amenities than described.   This made it difficult with the two babies. My biggest issue was that, one night all the fire alarms went off, and there was no response by the management.   At first they answered the phone, giving advice like “wave a tea towel in front of the alarm” and “open the windows”, then they stopped answering the phone.   The fire alarms, about 5 or 6, bombarded us with a high pitched squeal for 3 hours.   AND NOONE CAME TO CHECK IF MAYBE THERE WAS A FIRE! As I had booked to stay here on my return trip, I tried to cancel the second booking. Even though the guest house had made a point of telling me that my family was not welcome and that there was six weeks to my next booking, they refused to allow the cancellation. The day before I was to return to Sydney, I got an email explaining that I need to organize a key if arriving late.   When I rang to organize the key I was told by The Outback Lodge Manly that they had cancelled my booking.   It still showed as current on this site.

I laugh when people scrutinise rooms on 'Four in a Bed' but this hotel is just disgusting and i've no idea how it is selling itself as a 4* hotel. I'd seen</value><value> negative reviews but by then i'd already booked and it was non-refundable and had no other choice but to stay here.  Dirty, dated and shabby and in need of renovation. Very small reception/lobby area. There was a mouldy smell on the corridors and in the lift. Broken sink in the bathroom, holes in the walls and tiles from where fittings had obviously been removed.  Dusty skirting boards, dusty at the side of the bed and behind the bedside table - only saw as I was plugging phone charger in. Stained sheets, a cracked broken sink, rusty towel holder, bath with a shower with a cheap shower curtain round it, not even a glass screen!   Even the bedding was stained!!! To make it worse, they had the cheek to ask for a $100 'security deposit'!! As if the room could have ended up in any worse of a state? I took photos just in case they tried to blame me for any of the damage and refused to refund.   After my first night, I spent the second evening and night in agony with gripping pains and vomiting and diarrhoea. Bit of a coincidence considering i've been in Aus for weeks and been absolutely fine up until staying here. I rang reception during the night as I was due to check out at 11am and wanted to request late checkout as i've been up being sick all night and they said I could have until 12 for $30???

My room was a shocker, tiny room with a very small bed (my legs overhung the end of the bed) , the mattress was cheap and basic and the bathroom was less than inviting. Think somebody had a sense of humour with the name - Cityview is only appropriate if you think the city is a concrete jungle - my window looked onto a concrete wall.

<item><hotel_name><value>The Chee Bondi</value></hotel_name><title><value>A comfortable apartment near Bondi beach</value></title><content><value>Writing or reading a review is a tricky thing because both the reviewer and the reader relate the written experience to their expectations, which might be totally different. E.g. what is cheap to one might be expensive to another and vice-versa. The same applies virtually to</value><value> everything e.g. luxurious, tasty … Therefore I always organize my review to list the things we liked/disliked about the place and leave it to you to apply those to your expectations to decide how you would rate this place.  The Location: For those who want to spend the time at Bondi Beach the apartment is in a very good location a short walking distance from the beach and from numerous restaurants and shops in the same area. The apartment is in a small building with few other apartments.   Check-in and checkout: As there is no reception in the building you need to agree with the landlords your check in time. The landlords are very nice and helpful making you feel at home.  The apartment: the apartment called at booking.com Deluxe Studio consisted of -	one bedroom with a sitting area and dining table for two,  -	a small kitchen equipped with cutlery for two, a fridge and a cooker -	a small bathroom  The only nuisance there was the bathroom with very small sink where you will have difficulty to wash your hands or face. Also the mirror is on the other side than the sink. So if you are a traditionalist, like me, still using a razor and soap to shave it becomes a tricky mastery to shave with the sink in one place and the mirror in another. Therefore, I suggest to the landlords to minimize this inconvenience by adding a mirror behind the sink.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

Tesco Metro is literally around the corner so great to be able to pick up water, few last minutes items. Staff on reception and behind the bar we a pleasure to deal with, so</value><value> nice and friendly. There is a lift in the hotel lobby but quite small. Our room faced onto the street ans could be loud with traffic and at night time but we were both supplied with ear plugs ( you needed to keep the window open for some air.) Room was quite small for £140 a night, and you would not want to be a larger person or you would not fit in the shower. Our beds were comfortable and we got 2 decent sized pillows. Full length mirror on the wardrobe was greatly appreciated. I have seen other people complain about the breakfast, all cooked, or toasted sandwiches. I would prefer the option of having poached or scrambled egg instead of fried, and I agree with other people who stayed here that some fruit in the morning would have been nice.   The guy who did Karaoke every night ended up singing the same songs over and over, and we all found the PA system to be turned up so loud we couldn't hear each other without yelling. All the bar staff, cleaners, front of house staff were absolutely brilliant. The decor and facade of the hotel is amazing. It's a pity the hotel name has changed so many times - we found that taxi drivers were confused about what hotel we were talking about. This hotel only serves breakfast and no other meals.

The rooms are more than adequate for</value><value> a single traveller.  Clean and functional.  However, unless you are happy staying out late and not wanting to sleep before the early hours (if you are on that kind of trip then it would be perfect for you) then think twice (ear plugs were supplied in some of our rooms - and are essential).  The noise that travels up from the venue below can be heard extremely clearly in the rooms and is very disruptive.  The only option for breakfast is a cooked breakfast - no fruit, yoghurt or pastries on offer.  The breakfast itself is excellent - but more (healthier) choices would have been nice.  If you are in a partying group and want a late night venue with a cooked breakfast then go for it......if you want a quieter stay and some healthier options look elsewhere.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

Problem 2: Checking in was less that ideal. Trying to find a staff member in the downstairs restaurant that was in the middle of a refurb was a little confusing. Maybe some signage?  Problem 3: We got back at our room late at night to find water all up the hallway, down the walls and dripping from a light fixture. The aircon was responsible. We called and again got a “hello?” They said they would send someone. An hour later, still no one. Had to phone again and then a kid (probably 18?) came up and gave us some towels, no mop. Very polite but still, shouldnt it have been assessed for safety by an electrician or something? I mean the light switch was flickering with electricty! Did not sleep well that night!  Problem 4 and probably what I was most upset about: When checking out, I asked if they could please call us a cab. Receptionist said no and pointed out to the road. Ummm. What?! There was no taxi rank around! I was speechless. Your an apartment! That should be part of your standard service for every guest.   Overall the rooms were pretty good.

It’s a great spot for a vacation or for a base for a work trip.  This is a beautifully-restored former waterside pub, converted into holiday apartments.  We (my wife and my humble self) stayed in</value><value> apartment # 4, “The Parapet”.  I went ahead to set up camp whilst my wife was at a work appointment in downtown Sydney;  I was greeted by the very friendly Gerri who assisted with bags and was quite happy to explain everything about the apartment.  Certainly worth the effort to see the wondrous expression on my wife’s face when she got “home”.  The location of the apartments cannot be beaten.  You are quite literally steps away from the bus stop outside, or the Balmain East ferry wharf across the street.  If you come armed with an Opal Card, you will have mastered local public transport.    Unfortunately the Balmain East ferry wharf is currently closed for renovations (due to re-open in mid 2015); a pity, because nothing beats commuting on water – relaxing, usually prompt, and by-passing all those nasty land-based traffic jams.  Several other reviewers have commented on the bus turning point just outside.  I found that we simply just found ourselves getting used  to this, and noise then just faded away.   Car-parking is a challenge;  although Gerri can lend you a resident’s parking permit, it can still be hard to find a vacant street spot.  If you can travel without a motor vehicle, so much the better (and far more liberating for you, what with the range of public transport available).  Presumably, if you had the budget, you could use the water taxi system too.  Our apartment was very well kitted out, including a welcome basket of basic groceries.  You can supplement these with trips to the local East Balmain shops (up the hill), or to the main Balmain shops.  Both areas are an easy bus ride away (or walk up a steep hill to get to the East Balmain shops).  Being Christmas, the apartment even featured some seasonal decorations!  These homely touches went well in this beautifully decorated, clean and comfy apartment.  Add to this the large porch (including barbeque), where you can relax and watch the harbour traffic sail by (including some rather startlingly-sized ocean liners).  The kitchen is rather compact, but all worked out well for 2 people with a little bit of practice.    Taxis were a little bit hard to come by (being pre-Christmas), but Gerri had access to several drivers’ mobile phone numbers – thus enabling us to by-pass the radio rooms that continue to contribute to the mess that is  Sydney’s poor taxi system.  And that was about it, folks!  Lovely afternoons relaxing on the porch watching the boats sail by.  Walking around the neighbourhood to admire the very eclectic range and styles of housing is also worthwhile.  All in all, to really enjoy this lovely location you should leave the car at home if at all possible, and follow your nose to this harbour-side wonder.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

The room was dark, no air conditioning, the window was stuck, the bedding was dreadful. We booked in for a double bed and we got two single beds and double bunks.</value><value> There was no bathroom and the shared bathroom we were told we had to use was not even a bathroom. Our room was up 2 flights of stairs, (no lifts) and outside on a landing area that opened out to the laneway. The toilet was across the landing on our level past another room. The shower was across the landing and past another room and up some stairs. The Shower and toilet areas were also not clean. I would not let my dog stay in the room it was so bad. I paid for the room before seeing it and once we saw the room and the "bathroom" that wasn't a bathroom we decided we would not stay in there with the smell and dirty room. I went straight back down to the guy who checked us in and told he me that I could not get a refund as I didn't give him 48 hours notice to cancel. The reason I was cancelling was because the room was so disgusting. I, unfortunately, booked into this hotel on Lastminute.com. Be warned do not wait to pay at the hotel if you book this way as you can't get a refund. You can only do so if you book and pay with Lastminute.com. Thankfully we could book into the Oaks Goldsborough Apartments down the street. It was clean and much cheaper and the room was amazing. Lastminute could not issue me a refund as the owner of the Woolbrokers refused to issue one. I ended up being charged $129 dollars for nothing. The initial booking was to be $159, but the guy at the desk said he would give us a $30 discount as it was the last room. Little did we know that it was because the room, was the room from hell. They need to pay you to stay in the hotel not the other way around. BE WARNED, DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL it is DISGUSTING AND DIRTY.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

When we got our key and went to our room, two maintenance guys were standing on top of our bed in the bedroom (yes on top of the sheets) busy changing lights in the ceiling fan. They just said “Oh sorry we will be quick” so I figured we would wait. We sat there for almost ten minutes, then I told reception via message that someone was there and no one responded.   Eventually I went down and told them at reception and they just said Oh sorry!  I then stood around for another 10 minutes waiting to get another room. Fair enough they gave a room but I missed a meeting because of this and my fiancé had been working since early morning and wanted to sleep so we just had to wait around wasting time. When I went back to the initial room to pick up my bag the guys were STILL working in the room. How bad is that, and the fact that they think its okay for us to sleep in the room if other people were standing on the bed with their shoes.   They also market this as SERVICED apartments. Not once during our 3 night stay was any service done. No cleaning, no replenishing shampoos etc, nothing  The last night we got in our key also did not work anymore.

It was the</value><value> last weekend of the Lunar New Year celebration and everything was booked! We pulled off the freeway after soaring through weekend traffic into the Sydney CBD. No where to stay. After a quick search of the area we found the Alishan Guesthouse. What a stroke of luck! We stayed for three delightful days/nights. Clean. Comfortable. Well located. Great neighbourhood. Lots of excellent restaurants.  Staff was gracious and very helpful. Lovely and clean common kitchen, outdoor eating area, laundry facilities, bus stop at the door and less than 30 minutes on a single bus to the Circular Quay and the Rocks.  I would come back here in an instant and highly recommend it!  No - it’s not high end.

<item><hotel_name><value>Noah's Bondi</value></hotel_name><title><value>Absolutely disgusting</value></title><content><value>I booked a room for 3 days thinking it'll be a nice place to stay, with all the Bondi vibe, and the nice and neat people you can encounter over there. What a disapointment ! Paint on the walls is falling appart, mold in every corner of the bathrooms, ah ! The bathroom... It is a</value><value> joke ! Nothing to put your stuff (what are you supposed to do with your clean clothes whilst having a shower ?), only one half-broken sink with no soap, absolutely disgusting toilets where noone ever flushes, piss and toilet paper all over the floor, there's no shower cabins, it's two old school curtains with one giving on a urinal in front of it at 50cm ! I'm not kidding ! So the floor is always soaking in - you don't actually know if it's water or piss... The bath-"room" isn't actually a room, it's built in a corridor ! You can't be at more than 3 people, and you have to bump into each other to enter and get out. It's the door's width !!!  The dormatory rooms... Are filthy ! They are not cleaned on a regular basis. I asked to change my room because when I entered, there was chicken wings, papers, plastic bags on the floor, and, for the winner, a bottle of piss on top of the lockers ! I've then met a bunch of people who also asked to change room because of sanitary reason. The pillow and mattress are yellow, not just a little bit teinted by age, no, like, hasn't been washed/renewed in 30 years-yellow !  Only the rooftop is nice, but it isn't the big fuss it has been written about. I didn't try the kitchen. In order to be fair, I was in a room on the 3rd floor, I had a look at the bathrooms on the 2nd floor, and it was cleaner (no urinals). But still. You'd think, when they advertise "best stay at Bondi", that the standing would be much higher ! They kinda surf upon the reputation of the place to neglect the healthiness of the place. Would have thought to find this in Paris, really disappointed to find it in Sydney.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Royal Exhibition Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>PERFECT FOR TRAIN TRAVELLERS</value></title><content><value>Not knowing Sydney at all, I wanted to choose a hotel that was walking distance to Central railway station from where I could disembark after the short airport link trip. If I chose right, it should allow me to walk to that hotel and then take the train next day to Circular Quay</value><value> – right beside the cruise terminal. I packed a large suitcase with wheels, and a backpack for that purpose. BOY DID I HIT THE JACKPOT IN CHOOSING ROYAL EXHIBITION HOTEL. At the airport I was faced with a bank of ticket machines, but being a slow learner I asked at the booth if I could buy a single trip ticket to Central. She said: “If you have a pay wave card you can just touch on with it here to open the gate and touch off at Central”. Too easy even for me. So in return for “two touches” they took $1 out of my debit card for the trip - and everyone was deliriously happy! A platform attendant explained that I needed to leave the station via the Southern Concourse and out of EXIT 6. Too easy. After stepping off the escalator and out onto the footpath, I looked up and 50 metres across the street was a building identified as ROYAL EXHIBITION HOTEL! I was way too early to check in but sat at a table overlooking the street and read and googled and read until lunch time. The chatter and laughter of staff in the background made it feel like a friendly place to be and the staff were most helpful with my hotel and Sydney questions.  The hotel drink prices were cheap and they have probably a dozen wines available by the glass. I had a sparkling for $6.50 and a nice Chardy for $7.50. You’d be a fussy eater if you couldn’t find your perfect meal here. I ordered the double lamb shank with mash and peas ($26). They were large and cooked to perfection with delicious gravy and the meat just fell off the bones. Sensational. On entering the room, my first thought was “dated”. But if you look past the old timber desk; freestanding wardrobe and drawers, it has everything I’d ever need. The bathroom had been completely refurbished; the bedlinen was crisp and clean and my queen bed room was quite spacious. (Not sure if all rooms are similar) Free wifi had excellent reception. Would I choose this 3 star hotel again? Every time I am in Sydney! (And I didn’t even mention the great room rate) Only negative I can think of is that the bistro does not open for breakfasts</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

Old unrestored furniture dotted the room, high ceilings and what looked like recent carpet all added to the charm.

Suburban trains from Central go to Circular Quay (for harbour</value><value> ferries, etc), etc and also cross the famous bridge. Light rail trams also start at the Main Concourse of Central Station so easy to get to Darling Harbour. Outside it looked a bit of a mess as the new Light rail trams will be running soon which will also mean easy travel to main areas of Sydney. Room was great and the Staff were great as well. The street outside also had many varied small restaurants serving Thai, Indian, Chinese, etc, food so I was able to have a reasonably priced meal each night from different countries.Will certainly stay here on my next visit</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

This was followed by cement trucks, pumps and concreters who didn't give a damn about the noise they made and their music sucked. At 3 in the morning I went down to the bar and asked how long this was going to go on for only to be advised that the light rail people had a dispensation on noise pollution and they couldn't do much about it. WRONG! DON'T RENT THE ROOM when you know that nobody can sleep through the noise and vibration. Absolute con job. No other room available.

<item><hotel_name><value>Royal Exhibition Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Air conditioning, fan, windows, nothing works</value></title><content><value>30 year reunion with Telecom work mates, in the pub closest to the old office. I decided to bunk with an old mate, but a notorious snorer so opted for separate bedrooms, room 209, a queen bed in the main room, a separate queen room as well. The rooms were clean and tidy, the</value><value> bathroom was small, but modern and functional, although the shower door failed to retain the water. In the we hours on return to the room after the reunion downstairs, I noticed that the air conditioner in the separate bedroom did not work, nor did the fan, nor the window, but the one in the main room did. I decided to just leave the door open, as it was quite a warm and stuffy night, and a gut full of bale was not helping. Minutes later as I was hurtling off to sleep, my slumber came to an abrupt halt as I was wrenched back into consciousness by the sound of what could only have been a Supermarine Spitfire of WW2 fame lurched into life in the adjoining room. On brief inspection, it turned out my long time friend had beaten me to sleep. After persisting with the drone of said Rolls Royce Merlin for about 45 minutes, I could take it no more, and operated the only working thing in the room, the door, which due to its age was quite effective and  was effective at keeping out the noise, ant unfortunately any fresh or moving air. Fortunately, morning not only silenced the offensive cacophony but allowed me the comfort of a refreshing and much needed shower. All in all, an unpleasant experience.  </value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Arden House</value></hotel_name><title><value>Coogee’s Best Kept Secret !</value></title><content><value>Boutique guest houses can be a hit-and-miss affair. Some little more than shabby boarding houses. And I don’t mean “shabby chic”. I mean shabby d.i.s.m.a.l. As I discovered recently in Randwick, to my utter dismay. Ugh.   And, then, three minutes away by taxi from that disaster:</value><value> Arden House in Coogee: a REVELATION !   The first thing that struck me was the beauty of the place: an old house with high ceilings on two levels, the design aesthetic of the owner, David, is immediately apparent: it is exquisitely beautiful. The art, in particular, is gorgeous.   But form, even at this stunning level, never subordinates function: the enormous kitchen is very, very cleverly set out and allows multiple guests to prepare meals with ease.   The three bathrooms are also spacious and kept immaculately clean. With an additional toilet upstairs, there were always facilities available when you needed them. And the washing machines, clothes dryer and line space meant I didn’t have to spend money at the laundromat across the road.   And the rooms? Gorgeous! My bed was extremely comfortable and the room was tastefully decorated, again with an eye for the practical: a wardrobe, tall-boy, bedside tables and a desk with a flatscreen tv. Perfection!  More than just looking beautiful and providing tremendous practical convenience throughout, Arden House is kept immaculately clean by the lovely caretaker, John: a kind, thoughtful and generous man who could not do enough to make my stay a wonderful one.   Indeed, David and John are two of the world’s truly beautiful souls: they genuinely care about their guests and go out of their way to be kind and helpful. Upon fleeing Randwick (“shabby-miserable”, remember? I do!), I was potentially stuck with my luggage for several hours and an appointment to attend. No problem: I texted David, arrived Arden House to be met by John: my luggage was stored and, when I returned, it was in my room.   I think, too, the fact that John lives on site added to my sense of security: I didn’t lock my room once. And all the other guests I met - mostly young people on working holidays - were delightful. The place had a lovely serenity to it: it was peaceful. And safe.   John’s gesture - helping me with my luggage - a small act but enormously helpful - set the tone for what was an absolutely glorious time in a wonderful guest house in one of the most beautiful parts of the world: dinners in the courtyard, amongst the Bougainvillea, the bamboo and the palms; waking to the solitary call of a wattle bird in the grevillea outside my window; watching sunsets throughout the window from my bed; coastal walks; gelato by the beach; cafés; restaurants; David and John’s wonderful hospitality ...  As I said: Arden House: a REVELATION ! 🌺</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

The location- sits high above Manly (north Steyne) and although ground floor of 2 storey residence there is a great view, over a steep nature</value><value> reserve and out to sea. If there is a breeze this apartment will catch it; which is great on a hot day.  About 15 minutes walk unencumbered from the ferry terminal, allow longer if you are not particularly fit or carrying luggage. If the later maybe best to catch a cab. The last bit is uphill.  Once settled you can discover short cuts through the reserve to Manly township and the ocean.  The apartment - has a lovely bedroom with ample drawer storage, a very comfortable queen size bed, ceiling fan and window giving a private view over the neighbouring garden to the sea. The sound of the ocean and the quiet area gave us 5 excellent nights sleep. Bathroom is a generous size with shower, the usual toiletries and ample towels. Lounge room is nicely furnished with couch, dining table for 2, microwave, toaster, fridge and crockery. No kitchen sink but Tracey comes in while you are out and does the dishes, which was unobtrusive and worked well.  Again good storage, books and thoughtful touches like an emergency rain coat and beach towels. The treat is the balcony with an outdoor setting and that view. All the windows open and are lockable in both positions.  As this is a B&amp;B and a partitioned part of the family home you can expect the occasional and usually low level sounds of a family through the adjoining door. Tracey is very friendly and keen that her guests enjoy the area and their privacy.  We followed Tracey's directions for the beach walk to Dee Why and had lunch there.

Check out was easy and we left our luggage with Consierge until later in the day. Our son has stayed here many times when working in Sydney. For my husband and I, this was the first time that we had stayed there. Would definitely stay here again. Recommend it to others.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>The Royal Automobile Club of Australia Accommodation</value></hotel_name><title><value>Would we stay again - NO....!</value></title><content><value>My husband and I stayed here about 15 years ago so we knew that it was a private members club in an old building but the location for us was ideal for this trip to Sydney.  On booking I was advised that the rooms had been refurbished so we were really looking forward to some</value><value> improvements from our last visit.  It was very disappointing to walk into a room that probably hasn't changed much in the last century but we were very tired on arrival so didn't query the room until the next day when we were advised that only some of the rooms had been refurbished and they didn't include the Queen Room that we had booked.  We weren't advised of that when making the booking.  Unfortunately the plumbing for the room next door seemed to be in the wall next to our bed and whenever the shower or toilet was used in that room all you could hear was (very loud) water running through the wall.  Made sleeping very difficult.  The room was also dangerous for two elderly (late 60s and late 70s) people to stay in.  There were two large wobbly wooden steps up into the bathroom - there is a grab rail on the side of the doorway/wall but we found that you almost had to pull yourself up into the bathroom.  We had to leave the light on at night so we didn't fall on the steps.  The bathroom, which included the toilet, was quite long but not very wide.  You had to stand side-on to dry yourself because of the narrow width.  We were also led to believe that a full breakfast was included - it wasn't.  Buffet continental breakfast only - same every day so became very boring after the first couple of days.  Dining room staff during the week were extremely quick to remove plates, etc. from the tables - several times even before our last mouthful of food had been swallowed!  It definitely wasn't a welcoming environment during the week.  Weekend staff were totally different both in the dining room and also at reception.  All were very friendly, helpful and efficient - as were all the cleaning staff.  Our final insult from the week day staff was when we asked (on the Friday) if we could have a late checkout (on the Saturday) and was advised in very terse terms that it wasn't policy to have late checkouts and anyway they were fully booked on the Saturday night and the rooms had to be cleaned early for the new guests to arrive.  We did understand that and asked if we could check out at the required time and leave our luggage to be collected later in the day - this was allowable.  On checking out at the correct time on the Saturday morning we mentioned that we were a little disappointed that we wouldn't be able to freshen up prior to our flight and was advised that we should have requested a late checkout as they were not busy that night and that three people had already requested (and been allowed to) stay late that day.  We expressed our disappointment but as we had already packed up and checked out we just left it as it was.  Even the great weekend staff didn't make up for the very poor service and unhelpful attitude during the week - we won't go back there.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

Basically slept in a hot attic, paid way too much money and saw cockroaches climbing the walls. Was in an 11 person shared dorm, one toilet and three showers, one of which was broken. The toilet always</value><value> smelled really disgusting. There is no AirCon so you basically die when you sleep and wake up drenched in sweat. People who stay there are super rude, nobody talks to anyone else. I tried to stay out in Sydney for as long as possible just so I wouldn’t have to be back there and dreaded coming back every night. They make you strip the bed when you check out and everything underneath the blue sheets is stained completely yellow and smells like throw up, great so I slept on a dirty bed for 9 nights. I felt so trapped here. Like my worst nightmare coming true. Do yourself a favor and keep it moving, this is NOT the place to be.

<item><hotel_name><value>Abey Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Great location, pleasant staff, otherwise terrible</value></title><content><value>This hotel would have to present the worst value for money I've ever experienced. It's a 3 star hotel (at best) with a 5 star price tag (I paid $320 for one night single accommodation - extra for breakfast). The staff are pleasant and helpful and the location is great - quiet</value><value> and convenient. That's it for the positives. The hotel is in dire need of maintenance and some TLC. The hot water tap in the bathroom fell off in my hand and had obviously been that way for some time. I could have easily scolded myself. Tiles in bathroom were mouldy ( as is the swimming pool!); there are chips on most of the tacky laminated furniture and on the vanity in bathroom; bedside lights were not working and made of tinny fake copper; carpet is threadbare and dirty; kettle doesn't reach any of the power points. Basically there are things here which would be reasonably easy to fix but clearly the hotel has not taken the care to do so. In addition, the breakfast (for $20) was so poor I couldn't eat most of it. Gluten free bread was provided but it had been defrosted from frozen and was damp! No other gluten free options available. The only fruit provided was a very small quantity of water melon. Thank goodness for the sliced tomato and cheese or I'd have gone hungry. If you want a 3 star hotel, the Song nearby is less than half the price and much much better.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

If someone from the hotel does read this, may just need to have a quick look at the hot water in the shower in room 316 because it takes about 10 minutes for the hot water to come through.

It was an “accident” but we never actually received an apology which frustrated me.   Our room wasn’t the cleanest the spa bath had scratches from someone else’s nail polish, there was dust and bugs in there too. Then we saw a few cockroaches throughout our stay too.

<item><hotel_name><value>Valentine On George</value></hotel_name><title><value>Family Holiday in Sydney</value></title><content><value>As part of our family holiday we booked this hotel and were very disappointed with our experience. We booked  for 2 adults and one child (5 years old) and when we arrived at our room in the early evening we noticed there was not a roll away bed of any type for our 5 year old son</value><value> to use. I immediately looked at my booking, making sure it was for 3 people and then contacted reception to try and sort the issue out straight away.  I was told by the gentleman on the other end of the phone that we did not have a bed for our son as part of our reservation and that none was available for us to use. This meant that he had to sleep in the same bed as us which was extremely unsatisfactory, given that we had paid for him as part of our reservation. I was made to feel this was my problem and no solution was offered by the person on the phone for that night. Thinking that we may find a roll away bed or something similar for our second night once we returned to our room after a day exploring Sydney, we were once again disappointed to see that there was nothing for him to sleep on so he had to sleep in our bed again. There was no one at reception upon our return that night so we had no one to contact. A similar scenario occurred on our third and final night and this left a hugely negative experience on our family holiday. We paid for 3 people to stay at the hotel and yet at no point were 3 people catered for in our room. Our son had to sleep in the same bed as us, which meant we had terrible nights sleep and also there was never even a 3rd towel for him to use in the shower. Wouldn't recommend or use this hotel again!!!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Valentine On George</value></hotel_name><title><value>Good hotel close to Central Station and CBD</value></title><content><value>Stayed here for a couple of nights when we flew into Sydney. The hotel is a couple of minutes walk from Central Station and about 25 minutes walk to Circular Quay. There is nothing gltzy about the hotel frontage or reception. Our room was on the fifth floor and was set out like</value><value> a studio. A little coffee hub as you walked in, then a sitting area and bed area. The ensuite was on the other side of the entrance. The ensuite was huge with a great shower with plenty of pressure. The bed was comfortable but low to the ground. There was a "very" small TV in the sitting area and a single chair in front of it with bench type seating down one wall. All of the seating was very low. The room was clean and pretty quiet. If you are elderly be aware that the seating and bed are very low to the ground. Definitely not your average hotel but quite quirky. Would stay again and recommend as long as you are fairly flexible and can get up from low seats.

I just wish in the future they could designate a certain area for people who have booked separate from a huge group.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

The hotel is very close to central railway station and China town including market city etc. Only a short walk up George street to the centre of town. Plenty of cheap eating places close by. The hotel is old</value><value> and in need of a upgrade but is clean enough. My room was big enough, bed was ok, tv was very poor old with a bad picture. The bathroom shower only was again ok. The hotel has a dining area but I never used it. A pub at the front was popular serving food and offering daily promotions on food and drink. Reception staff were polite and helpful. At the moment there is lots of work taking place outside the hotel regarding the new tram system but this to me was not an issue during my stay.

So when I went to book for January I didn't expect an issue. First of all, note that we're a</value><value> family, so the email is family, the family credit card is in my name, the hotel booking site is in my husband's, Trip Advisor is in mine, the car is in his, you know the sort of thing when you can't be bothered doubling up on everything. Well this time in response to our booking I received an email from them asking for copies of my ID, and both sides of my credit card! They threatened that if they didn't receive that within 96 hours they would cancel the booking. I asked why they would want me to do something so unsafe and they said it "was for our protection"! I pointed out all the times we'd stayed, including last week, and it wasn't a problem, so why now, I certainly wasn't sending such phishing info to them. They then said I had 24 hours to do it or else no booking. I contacted the booking site, and as the hotel had used their communication link, the booking site could see the phishing request on record. They confirmed it was totally inappropriate and that the hotel would be marked for suspicious credit card activity, and the booking was cancelled, with no cost guaranteed by the booking site. Stay-wise, they're cheap and central, basic but convenient. but we won't be back. Asking for the info they did is not "for our protection", quite the reverse, it's a huge security risk.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Ryals Serviced Apartments - Camperdown</value></hotel_name><title><value>It's Ok...</value></title><content><value>We needed accommodation near PA Hospital and had tried others which were ordinary, so hence experiment with Ryal. Think there are only some apartments in this building which belong to Ryal so there is no front desk. It looks more like a a domestic apartment block than serviced</value><value> apartments. When you arrive you have to ring the Manager on Duty (very friendly)...he gives you the code to unlock a letterbox in the foyer which contain your apartment keys. HINT: when booking mention you need parking so they can give you a remote for the garage. The basement parking is tight and is on a first come first served basis. You will be assigned a parking spot number but don't be surprised if there is some one else in your spot. There is a lift from basement straight to your apartment floor. Because you have a remote for the garage door it is much easier than a hotel (with entry and exit tickets) to come and go regularly. The area is very quiet despite being just off Paramatta Rd. It is also next door to one of the best Cellars in Sydney. The one bedroom apartments are reasonably spacious however are poorly furnished and the bed is a small King with polyester sheets. There is a small outside balcony so you can get fresh air. AC is in the lounge only with a fan in the bedroom. Bathroom has a shower ,small sink and the laundry. A few days is fine but I think it would be a bit depressing for longer. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Sydney City Lodge</value></hotel_name><title><value>More of a backpackers than the hotel as advertised </value></title><content><value>Like a challenge to get into small spaces? Well this is the place for you! With a ridiculously small access being awkward enough to get a suitcase and backpack into on its own then the fun of getting inside is even futher increased by the only way up is via a crazy steep</value><value> stairwell as there are NO elevators at all either! Photos will be attached with review! One person of a couple that arrived as we did had to find alternative accomodation as she has a wheelchair. Well the staff didn't want to hear from the upset partner that they should advertise this place as non stairgoer friendly so as we were a group of 3 couples and only needed 1 nights stay we would give it a go anyway as we had already booked and paid!  So Up the stairs we climb hoping noone needs to come back down and into our room which was right next door to the the communal kitchen facilities which by the way is Awesome if you like to be woken by people making a coffee or snacks all night with the beeping of the microwave and clunking of cups and dishes in the sink!  Oh and its like having your own talkback radio stuck on with the hotel communal sitting area just outside room with your non soundproof doors.  Out of the 3 rooms we as a group hired not one bathroom had a door that wasnt broken and just to top it off My mate found a cockroach near his bed so decided to take it to reception to emphasise his unhappiness with our accomodation! Funny story but they didn't want the roach at their desk either!!  After an awful nights sleep i needed a wake up shower to find that our water heater was freezing and not to mention gross mould build up around the sink photos will be attached!.  Also a couple of days after we left they charged non existant mini bar charges to our friends room. They were refunded after enquiry and complaints but made us concerned about what they did with our credit card details they photo copied front and back! Also a warning with the bathroom doors there are warning signs that steam from bathroom sets off fire alarms and that there will ne a $1700 fine charged to customer if they are set off! Lucky we had no hot water!  For cheap and just needing a bed for the night its ok but next time would spend a few more dollars for something better.   It is a good location for walking to opera house and cruise departure and central for shopping and bars.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

After a 13 hour bus journey we arrive here with all our bags to be presented by squashed cockroaches at the entrance &amp; ‘Sofia’ an incredibly rude receptionist, who, as we try &amp; squeeze through the door to reception, makes zero effort to welcome us &amp; even</value><value> though she’s located clearly infront of us consciously ignores us. We ask if it’s possibly to check in, in which she replies “not until 2”. I understand that this is standard procedure to a certain extent in most hostels so this is not a problem. She didn’t offer to help with any of our luggage even though we arrived 5 &amp; a half hours before their allocated check in time, then looked at us in discust when asked if we could store our things somewhere. We walked around city to try &amp; kill the time. We then arrive back at 1:15 wet &amp; cold from the weather, but she refuses to let anyone check into their rooms until exactly 2oclock. After all of this they then make a mistake with our booking &amp; we get allocated beds in two seperate rooms even though we clearly booked as a pair. ‘Sofia’ being the miserable, disgruntled woman that she is, showed zero sympathy towards our situation &amp; did absolutely nothing to resolve the issue or make it any easier. In each of our seperate rooms there are spare beds still, but she refuses to let us pair up. They also refuse to give us any kind of refund. The bedrooms are dirty &amp; dingy &amp; the hostel has zero atmosphere. I feel like I’ve been sent to military jail to serve a sentence. Every wall is labelled with warning signs of everything you are not allowed to do, all highlighted with the fines which will be imposed if broken.

<item><hotel_name><value>The Mercantile Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Noisy, basic, but good location.</value></title><content><value>When we booked two rooms in this hotel, we thought our rooms would have ensuite bathrooms, so we were disappointed and upset that we had not caught the fact that the bathrooms are shared.  The rooms themselves faced the front, the street, and were above the bar.  As one might</value><value> expect, the noise level here was on the loud side well into the night.  We kept the air conditioner cranked up to help cover the bar and street noises.  There is no elevator, so if you have difficulty carrying your luggage up stairs, you may want to request a room on a lower floor or at another hotel instead.  The bathrooms looked clean (considering they are shared) but we were happy we had some flipflops that could be worn in the shower.  The bed and bath linens felt, looked, and smelled clean.  Everything in the rooms worked, although we did not turn on the television to test that.  The wifi was acceptable too.  Breakfast the following morning was nothing special, but it was adequate with assorted breads, jams, cereals, fruits, and that sort of thing.    The primary benefit to this place is the location.  Smack in the middle of things, it makes a convenient base from which to explore Sydney.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

At night with the lights on, and being on a main road, this wasn't very good.   Location. Accessible location, less than 5m walk from local supermarket, Coles and Kings Cross Station.

This let us down somewhat as the unit was very smelly. The smell was worse when the unit was switched off but even when on, you could smell it.   Noise. Quite noisy. There's no double glazing so you could hear everything outside, esp the roadworks which started at 8am everyday.   Room service. Got better as the week went by! The first day, the cleaner didn't make the bed properly but after that it was perfect. Cleaning of surfaces incl kitchen or table areas, bathroom doesn't seem to be included.   Staff.

However the Annam can arrange a shuttle to the airport for $18 and we took advantage of this for our return trip. We walked just about everywhere around town, it was so easy. Coles supermarket was five minutes walk away, but there were plenty of other supermarkets on route to the city. There are plenty of restaurants and take-aways so you will never go hungry!

Stayed for 2 nights in the hotel, and the service was awesome. Reserved parking outside, dumped the car and enjoyed the amenities. Very clean, however is experiencing some renovations on the first floor  This location on has 30 rooms, suites</value><value> are located on the second floor.  Stayed in one of the harbour suites, southern side. Fantastic room, plenty of room, howeevr has a massive tree thats blocks the view partially. Recommend trying to get the northern side harbour suite. Has a great little balcony, city views. Can be a little noisy with the pub below, thats to be expected.  I RECOMMEND: Okay, this is a great little hotel. Went to Doyles for lunch, used the pub facilities to have a few cocktails after lunch, full pub facilities below. Location is excellent, some excellent little viewing locations such as the The Gap are nearby. Ferry wharf allows city excess easily, do consider day trip and return. Breakfast included, continental style only available. GO FOR THE SUITES on the Second floor, Harbour views! Northern suite better than southern, its just a tree that partially blocked, but ask for this in preference.  Issues had are of no fault of the Hotel, such as a Search and Rescue helicopter nearby at 1.30am, did offer good entertainment. Very clean and modern.   SCORE_ 90/100 High distinction.

I believe that the Receptionist of a hotel can either make or break their reputation and can affect your overall stay,  as they are the first port of call, so to speak.  Upon arrival, we were pleasantly greeted and welcomed by James, who also gave us information as to where we could go for breakfast the next morning as  it understandably isn’t served at the hotel, but other meals are available in their lounge bar.  As we were on the second floor in a twin share room, the lift was wonderfully quaint and old world, and despite it’s looks, worked very well.  Our room was lovely and very clean, comfortable and relaxing, and no noise could be heard coming from the bar below.  I was particularly delighted to see that there were tea making facilities and a bar fridge. As I have stayed in many international hotels without these facilities, it was a very welcoming sight!  I rated this hotel as excellent because of the service we received, the delightful room, and also the close proximity to everything.

<item><hotel_name><value>Sydney Central YHA</value></hotel_name><title><value>Good basic accommodation in Central, better second experience</value></title><content><value>Four years ago I stayed at the Central YHA and had an atrocious experience. You can see my old review on TripAdvisor.   But, a lot has changed in that time and my second experience with Central YHA overall was much better.  First, the hostel has been remodeled so it's clean,</value><value> bright, cheerful and more modern. Yes, there are still no plugs by the bed, and they have the metal frame bunks, but the linen is better, lockers are new and overall look and feel is more welcoming. Bathrooms are still tight, but there have been updates to the showers, and the hostel is very clean on the room floors.  I stayed in winter and it wasn't very busy at all, which was also really refreshing. Rooms could be chilly at night and morning and there is no AC so in summer, this would be toasty.  Kitchens are still basic and a bit outdated, but clean and pretty well maintained. The seating area is comfortable as well and also remodeled with a few different seating set ups.  When I was there, I didn't hear construction noise on the light rail outside the hostel and once that is finalized, that will be a huge upgrade to the location of this hostel. Any room facing Pitt street (e.g. rooms ending with 19) are loud in the evening and mornings so FYI there. Higher the floor, the better.  Staff was fine when I interacted with them, polite and helpful.   I ended up staying here several times while passing through Sydney for my visa run and visa processing and it's a good value for basic accommodation. I was really pleasantly surprised by my time here and would definitely return again</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Railway Square YHA</value></hotel_name><title><value>Not bad if you're not really into sleeping</value></title><content><value>Picked this hostel purely on the basis of location since I was carrying around heavy sports equipment so wanted to be close to the rail station. While i knew it was close, I certainly didn't expect to be right next to the actual rail platform.  If you open the blinds, people</value><value> from the platform can literally peek into the room. The place was constantly vibrating and you could hear the announcements very loudly ever 5-10 minutes. Very poor sleep due to this even though the beds and pillow were comfier than usual hostels.  The other facilities were fine. Showers and toilets were clean, however there are some cubicles with large gaps in the doors so find a good one and stick with it. Kitchen looked good with lots of storage and space, but had very few sharp knives, no oven and extremely poor quality pans (and also not enough).  While I wasn't there specifically for socialising because I had other plans, there seemed to be a lot of long termers there and also a lot of families or older groups so was a strange atmosphere, but they do put on lots of events, free food or cheap meals every day so I'm sure they're definitely worth checking out. WiFi is free but I found videos to buffer when using anything above 360p  Even for the location, I wouldn't stay here again and looking back it was actually pretty expensive. There will be better and cheaper options around. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

Sylvia was friendly and kind when making the booking and I loved how she even sent me through a list of instructions for getting to YHA after I arrived off the train. It was easy to access from arriving in the airport because I could get a quick train from the airport to Central Station and then a simple walk to the hostel. Sleep quality was average but when you're in Sydney, the place is full of energy that you want to be a part of it and to absorb all the energy which is enough reason to get out of bed in the morning.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

They are such friendly people and they really helped</value><value> make the stay a pleasant one.  They were always keen to help us and were very polite and obviously worked hard.  Our room was a basic double downstairs room with a shared bathroom upstairs.  We were made well aware of the stairs and shared bathroom prior to our visit, so no surprises there.   Our room was a good size, comfortable bed and sheets were clean.  I feel the room had a few bits on the floor that could have done with a vacuum.  The breakfast was nice and set us up well for the day, which was why we booked here even though we had a shared bathroom.  The location is a real plus here, we could go down to the action at the Harbour and easily return to our room to rest and then go out again without too much distance.    Best things. 1. Friendly hosts, 2. Comfy bed, 3. Good breakfast.  4. Location!  Things that would enhance, 1. The upstairs toilet had a basin and soap, but no hand towel to dry hands, so unless we remembered to bring one, you had to open door with wet hands.  2. Some more attention to detail with cleaning and a freshen up.   </value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Sydney Harbour Bed and Breakfast</value></hotel_name><title><value>Avoid at all costs!!!</value></title><content><value>I can't explain enough how bad this B &amp; B is.  After arriving from a 14 hour flight, we arrived in the morning to drop our bags off. Unexpectedly the room was available which we were relived about until we got to our room. I had reserved a two bed suite with private bathroom and</value><value> Kitchette. However what I got was one bedroom with a bed in the kitchenette ( I kid you not!) When we spoke to the manager we were told "I did you a favour by putting a extra bed in" He then got extremely rude and tried to block us leaving the premises. There was also medication in his top pocket which fell out during his rant. I'm travelling with my 70 year old mother, who at this point is in tears. I called a Uber just to get her away. The fact that we've never been to Australia before and left without anywhere to go should tell you how bad our experience was. The only bit of advice I can give you if your not happy with your room is take pictures/videos. We left with the manager shouting at us they we would never see a penny in a refund. He also said he didnt give a damn (you can fill in the words I'm sure) what review i gave on trip advisor. Normally if I have a bad experience I don't air it on the internet but this I can't let go without saying something. I booked with Booking.com who originally said there would be no refund. However upon numerous telephone calls and the video evidence they have issued me with a full refund and asked me to submit  a further claim if I've incurred additional costs to secure accommodation. When I booked I was expecting a 4 star B &amp; B, I sure a hostel would have been a step up. We had a fantastic Uber driver who dropped us to a cafe to help calm my mother down and gave me loads of help to find new accommodation. Two policeman walked past and he called them in as he was so shock by our treatment and asked them to go to the B &amp;B. I can't load video as trip advisor doesn't allow format but please people avoid.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

The rooms are small, but functional, and the beds are</value><value> comfortable.   In the last year or so it has become a bit shabby: toiletries have been downgraded to cheap and paint-stripper quality; and mini-bar is more dilmah than twinnings, there are no coffee makers. Baths and basins are old, surfaces are chipped, tapware has been updated, but overall the bathrooms feel decidedly 3 stars. My last stay I was in a large but soulless room: enormous floor space barely lit by small window looking onto a wall, and sparse furniture, giving it a feel of a huge cupboard converted into a bedroom.   The ambiance and service remain largely pleasant. But overall, it is a confused experience.  </value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

I recommend this hostel if you are looking for budget accommodation in the city centre (the hostel is 5 minutes from Sydney central station and close to bus stops, perfect to visit the city using public transport).</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Big Hostel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Very Nice Hostel Centrally located for the price</value></title><content><value>I am very please with the Big Hostel. The hostel is in the perfect location. Just a five minutes walk to the Central station. Not far from the Hyde Park.  The staff members ROCK!!!  I met many nice travelers and staff members at the BH . Steve the front desk receptionist is</value><value> really a great guy very helpful!!  The TV room is really nice. It attach to the Kitchen and tables there to enjoy breakfast with other fellows.  Kitchen open up around the clock so you can enjoy getting your mid night snack stored in the food shelf or refrigerator. There is a roof top available to enjoy the fresh air and chit chat with travelers.    I had an 8 bed dormitory which was fine with me. There also a locker available you just need to buy your own lock.  you can buy a small combination number lock at the front desk.  If you want a lock with a key you need to get it at the "Convience store" for $5AU. same price for the combination lock. I prefer the lock with key type so it easier to open and close especially at night when there others sleeping at night so, you do not have to worry using the flash light to look at the number on the combination lock.  When checking in they provide you a clean sheet and pillow case you put on by your self and remove the sheet and pillow case before check out. I had a hard time putting sheet on on the top bunk bed.    As far as for breakfast, Food are totally alternative. What you get is bread for toast, cereal, tea and coffee.  The Kitchen have a lot of ample space for cooking and storing your food.    There is a computer available if you get tired of using your laptop or your phone of courses.   Location is about 98 walk score.  There a 7-11 store, Convience store, Yok Yok Thai restaurant just two blocks very good thai food.  Spicy I am is another Thai restaurant. Vietnamese restaurant I did not dry.  Sash Japanese restaurant just one block is $$$ expensive it basically a shared type of food I had small taco sushi for $9 I had two of them total of $18 plus surchage total of $20.00 the waitress are very friendly, chef is great.    Laudnry is available to do a load is $8.00 total.  cup of soap $1.00  Wash is $4.00 Dry  is $4.00 Totalis $9.00  Very clean Very friendly totally secure Location is great  Next time I stay at the big hostel I want to get a 4 bed dormitory type with a private bathroom disabled access.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

Checked-in to our SoHo Suites, it was so spacious! (Coming from Hong Kong, it's just amazing to see so much space!!) The suites comes with fully equipped kitchen (there is an island), which</value><value> is amazing. It made me feel very relax to cook (as I love cooking!) I kept telling my husband how I love the kitchen.  Overall ambience is good. Love the living and dining room.  Location is great, just about 5-10 mins walk to Market City and probably about 30 mins walk to George Street.. etc.  Even better if with the following points: i) Coin operated washer dryer on location or in the apartment itself.  ii) Water pressure in our room wasn't powerful enough.  iii) Like the multi-ambience lighting options switch - however, if it's can be installed higher would be great idea as kids like to play with the switch so kind of annoying.

For those travelling with kids, you'll know that space is everything. We love spacious rooms, and in Zara, space is no longer an issue.   Everything you need is in the suite. Kitchen appliances, you name it they</value><value> have it. From Nespresso machine to a rice cooker. Basic bath amenities are also provided They can restock the toiletries and towels everyday if necessary.   My favourite part is, they clean your suite everyday.   The Apartment is also strategically located in the city. There's a Coles not too far from the apartment (about 3 blocks walking), and there are many coffee shops and restaurant around.  One thing that we didn't realize when making the booking is that there is no washing machine inside the apartment. We thought that both the luxury apartment and soho suite all have washing machines inside.   All in all, this place is highly recommended for those looking for space and convenience.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Larmont Sydney by Lancemore</value></hotel_name><title><value>Proved to be a fantastic choice - stay here</value></title><content><value>I have just checked out after a 3 night stay. A wonderful hotel in a well connected location. c. 30/35 walk to the Sydney Opera House via the Royal Botanic Gardens and a 2 minute walk to the metro station which takes you to Bondi Junction in less than 10 minutes. I arrived after</value><value> an overnight flight from the US and the hotel catered for an early check in at 9am which was great. This option is available if you book direct with the hotel (if they have the rooms available). If you book direct you can also access other benefits such as 2 free mini bar items per day and use of the gym next door.   As a young professional from London this hotel was exactly what I was after during my stay in Sydney - a cool hotel in a cool area. Added bonuses included sparkling wine on offer in the lobby in the evenings and the divine breakfasts in the hotel restaurant which were reasonably priced if you’re breakfast isn’t included. There is also a brand new Barry’s gym 3 minutes walk from the hotel which I went to before breakfast one morning. I’m really glad I decided to stay in the Potts Point area as you’re close to everything but away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist hot spots.   Overall, the service was top notch and they couldn’t do enough for their guests. Thank you Larmont. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

On booking we advised we would arrive between 12pm - 1pm.  We arrived at 10:45am and were told that our room was not ready and that we were getting a room upgrade as it was my hubby's birthday.  A really nice</value><value> gesture.  They kindly kept our bags and we went to explore the hotel and were told that they would ring when our room was ready.  I advised reception to ring my Hubby's mobile as mine was low on battery.  2 hours later, no phone call on either phone.  Went to reception and was told there was a query with our card but no one rang to tell us.  Arrived at our room and shortly after arrival staff arrived with a bottle of wine, box of chocolates and a card from the hotel wishing by hubby a happy birthday.  We were both really impressed by the thoughtfulness of the star and its staff.   The hotel has every amenity needed for a stay in Sydney.  It is in close proximity to the ferry, making it easy to get around the harbour .  Close to the Maritime museum, Sea-life centre and bars and restaurants on darling harbour.  You can walk to circular quays which is about an hour.   It has a casino, bars, restaurants, shops and a food court.  We ate in the Harvest restaurant for breakfast and the food was lovely with a great choice and the restaurant very clean.  All the staff we spoke to were friendly, helpful, immaculately presented and cheerful, a credit to the star.  The apartment was very clean and my only criticisms would be the lights in the apartment need dusting, the chip in the side of the bathroom sink needs repairing, marks on the entrance to the apartment wall needs covering and some of the furniture is chipped and marked which I would not expect in a luxury hotel.  A great stay and a fantastic weekend, thanks to the star and its staff.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

Staff were excellent at both check-in and check-out. Was a very short stay while in Sydney briefly so did not use many of the amenities.  However, I was most disappointed with the fact that there was no proper windows in the</value><value> room. The blinds were shut which I thought was strange when I entered the room and was sad to find that the ‘windows’ were all opaque. Appreciate privacy issues but hotel rooms in Australia should have windows.  Anyway, would suggest that you ask for a room with a window if you stay at Primus.  The staff were so good that I would try this place again. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Altamont Hotel Sydney - by 8Hotels</value></hotel_name><title><value>Diamond in the Rough</value></title><content><value>I spend every second week in Sydney for work and have for more than a year.  After trying various hotels and private apts I was becoming very disheartened with finding the right place that would make my time away from home and family more comforting and enjoyable without</value><value> imposing on friends all of the time.   I came across the Altamont through Tripadvisor.  With good reviews and great value for money I thought I'd give it a go.    Well I've now stayed about six or so times and so glad I've found somewhat a "home away from home".  The decor is very cool, laid back with a comfy non-sterile feel.  My best friend came down with me one trip and she really enjoyed her time there as well.  There's plenty of places to find somewhere to dine, walking distance to one of my fav precincts Crown and Oxford as well as the city.  Also a couple mins walk to the train then short trip to the city and off to wherever you choose - I work in Chatswood and find it very hassle free, even in peak hour.    There's a roof top garden which is great to chill on at night with a wine and free continental bfast in the mornings.    Depending on the room, you can sometimes hear people coming back from the cross walking down the alley and street beside the hotel, but I find it more entertaining than annoying.  Definately give this place a go, it's so worth it.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

Being a Sydneysider myself, I was particularly proud of the quality of this hotel, and the decor and all the little touches - the ever so friendly owner, or perhaps even just</value><value> the receptionist, I wasn't too sure, because whoever is was, loved their job and loved the hotel. They gave me tips on where to park my car without getting a ticket! I had a very relaxed, albeit, one night stay, but well worth the effort.

<item><hotel_name><value>Harbour Rocks Hotel Sydney - MGallery Collection</value></hotel_name><title><value>Wonderful weekend!!</value></title><content><value>My husband and I stayed here in 2012 when it had just reopened after refurbishment! It was stunning then and still is!  After 7 years of travelling overseas we decided to revisit.  We have stayed in 100’s of 4 to 5 star hotels and not many have the ability to make you feel</value><value> really at home. This place does!  Obviously as it’s a smaller boutique hotel they have an advantage, and we absolutely loved it!  So much that we didn’t have our usual late night out, instead getting back by 10pm to enjoy the room, the view, the wine and the awesome brownies we were given on arrival.  Our room (307) had a view of amazing lit up trees and the Harbour Bridge from our pillows, and when you sat on the lounge you could see the Opera House.  The 2 flights of stairs we had to make were worth it once you looked out the window!  The whole hotel was very clean and was warm and cosy. The toiletries were lovely and the decor is absolutely beautiful.  The best thing about this hotel other than its location is the customer service. We were looked after by the lovely Winnie both at check in and check out. She personally delivered a great bottle of wine to us to welcome us back, and was so genuine and attentive.  Breakfast too was absolutely delicious and the service was great.  The room service menu from the restaurant attached looked amazing but we didn’t try it, maybe next time.  There was a little noise during the night from the street below, but I’m a very very light sleeper. My husband heard nothing. But what do you expect when you are right in the middle of the action. Everything is at your doorstep. Literally!  Highly recommended, and thank you HRH for a wonderful weekend!!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

Best tip was to avoid the expensive Bridge Climb and going up the Bridge pylon with museum for $15 per person.  We even got a senior discount ($5 off the price).  Breakfast food provided was much more than expected.  The studio itself, is extremely clean and well equipped.  We did not get to explore much of Annandale and would have enjoyed the local walk Keith recommended.  Next time.

They are quiet too,</value><value> good soundproofing as we hardly noticed the night roadworks happening the 1st night. All the staff were friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble, hard to get service like that theses days. The cafe is perfect for breakfast, with a small but lovely menu &amp; good coffee. If  wanting to relax after a day out, then there is the opportunity to relax here with a glass of wine &amp; cheese platter or just a cuppa.

BEFORE we left I had called the restaurant to book a table, the person advised they don’t take</value><value> bookings however the restaurant was only half full and there would not be an issue in getting a table. They mentioned became full we would have to sit in the living room and order from the menu.  Upon arriving we walked to the restaurant and we were greeted by a very rude young lady who had an accent. She looked us up and down firstly (we were dressed smart casual) and asked for our room number. Once advised we were not staying in the hotel she said wait here and she will check wether we could dine here or not. The attitude of this lady was absolutely patronising and really off putting. She then had the floor manager walk past and had a word to him and came back and said “you can take from the buffet but you have to eat in the other room”  The restaurant at best was half full....many empty tables and she advised she had to keep all the seats just in case their in house guests decided to eat there for breakfast.  The overall attitude was really disgusting, it was like we had a disease or we were not good enough to dine at this establishment. Even further disappointing  was there was only 3 of us and many empty tables on the floor.  I had looked at her in disbelief, feeling like we were treated as peasants, it was like she was banishing is to the “kids” table! Her attitude and manner was extremely cold and stone faced, and not once in all the 5 star hotels and resorts I’ve stayed in has the service and demeanour been so poor and disgraceful.  I replied to her that we would go elsewhere and we did, we went to The Four Seasons just up the road and had a wonderful breakfast, with great food and very attentive service.  </value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

And my second experience here was overall really nice.  Hostel is in a great location of The Rocks and the view from the roof of the harbour</value><value> is lovely at day or night. It's about a 10 minute walk from Circular Quay, which is a stop off the airport line.  I was in a 4-bed dorm which was great size and enough space for four people comfortably (and with luggage). Having the bathroom attached was also a nice treat.  Kitchen at the hostel is big and enough space, but I was here in fall/winter when it was quieter so could be busier in summer or holiday time. Kitchen is well equipped too, although none of the pans were heat resistant on the handles so you had to use multiple towels to handle hot cooking equipment.  Laundry is on-site and powder is available for sale too. Breakfast and coffee is available too for purchase although I did not end up buying.  Closest full grocery store is about 25 minutes walk away, smaller metro market is about 10-15.   Hostel hosts a lot of activities too and was very welcoming for people to join, other than that, it's not a very social place, people mostly kept to themselves.  My only real complaint from my stay was Wifi. It kicks you off regularly and was very inconsistent in working in the main common areas.   Would recommend this place and stay again.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name><value>Cambridge Hotel Sydney</value></hotel_name><title><value>Up a Step From the Average....</value></title><content><value>YOU COULD DO WAY WORSE THAN STAYING AT THE CAMBRIDGE....  Lady Eldo and I have stayed at several Sydney hotels in this range in recent years – this is one of the better with service, rooms, facilities and location better than the average. We were also impressed with speed of</value><value> check-in/out, the quality toiletries and other inclusions and the general lack of noise which we have found is a problem for inner city properties.  The one demerit I could think of is that the pool is kinda small – abt 9mx3m. It has a separate shallow shelf for kids and a spa to the side. No worries, it was closed for repairs, although reception said they could organise a complementary visit to a nearby pool – nada: a bit cold to be walking the streets with damp hair.  Note too the hotel no longer runs a gym – but gave me a complementary pass to a fantastically spacious and well equipped commercial gym no more than 5 minutes walk.  TIPS – this is a good area on the CBD fringe no more than 17mins walk from city central (TOWN HALL), and closer to railway stations (MUSEUM STATION’ = 9min walk), and CHINA TOWN (17min). Major bus routes run along nearby (4 min) OXFORD ST (most start at CIRCULAR QUAY or CENTRAL RAILWAY STATION and go thru to the beaches or WATSONS BAY near the harbour exit). The ferries at CIRCULAR QUAY or DARLING HARBOUR (both 30mins) are a fair walk but the former is say10 mins in a bus or train. The nearest tourist attraction is the ANZAC WAR MEMORIAL (9min walk). - the area has a host of eats joints covering all budgets incl. the nearby OXFORD VILLAGE mall’s (4mins) several inexpensive sit-down places. But note I had a look at the hotel’s own dining room – it was packed with a boisterous crowd (didn’t seem just hotel guests) on a slow Wednesday night, which suggests it might be a local must-go (I didn’t on account I’m a dedicated cheapskate – the cheap and cheerfuls at OV are more my scene) - OXFORD VILLAGE has a good variety of other businesses -  a bottle shop, that good gym, hairdressers, an ALDI supermarket and several others. Well worth a visit. - OXFORD ST is a bit of an entertainment precinct after dark.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Nesuto Woolloomooloo Sydney Apartment Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>great value and location</value></title><content><value>We stayed in the apartments for a week in late March, went traveling, and came back for a second stay. The hotel is convenient to many locations in Wolloomooloo and easy and peaceful walking distance to city center.  My family and I cooked every night in the apartment - so it</value><value> was great to be close to grocery shopping and have a variety of pots and pans available. Quiet streets and not a lot of noise (except for the kookaburras screeching) so, we slept well - a king-sized bed for the adults and a smaller, cozy bed for our ten year-old.   The free breakfast downstairs was minimal but awesome to have. We took advantage every morning. Being able to do laundry in the apartment was a bonus!  The only reason why I cannot give a 5-star rating, is that the apartment itself had a terrible odor --- something like dirty socks  - that no matter what we did (burn candles/incense, open windows) would just not go away.   Still, the staff went over and above - we were able to store out luggage and they were very helpful in directions. The pub next door is super friendly and they have trivia night every week - !  We'd stay there again, if we can sniff the room first! Thank you!!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name><value>Nesuto Woolloomooloo Sydney Apartment Hotel</value></hotel_name><title><value>Excellent location, great price</value></title><content><value>We stayed here four nights at the end of a three week Australian holiday. We initially had an Air B&amp;B which didn’t work out big time so I searched Expedia and came across this place. The price was great and the location seemed okay. So we booked it and hopped a ride. I am so</value><value> glad we did. The reception we received from Brad was excellent. What a gem of a guy he really helped us out! Our room was on the third floor with a king two twin bed layout. Yes it could use a few touch ups but the room was very spacious, very clean, bed was super comfy with lots of pillows! Yeah ! Plenty of bath linens, and toiletries. We had a washer drawer combo in the washroom which was excellent. The kitchenette was clean and had all the necessities for our stay. The building has a locked entry which was comforting and the elevator can only be operated with a key. This location was very close to the marina and a lovely walk to circular key and the sites of CBD. Lots of eating out options nearby and a supermarket a short walk. We were so pleased with this accommodation. Location excellent, cleanliness excellent, service excellent. Friendly , helpful staff all around. I would definitely stay here again.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

We were just so disappointed last Monday when we stayed in Room 139. The tap was barely connected to the</value><value> basin in the bathroom. The shampoo, conditioner and body wash were just bottles lying on the shower floor. The saucepan and glasses were dirty and had to be washed. And the worst part were the two large cockroaches that appeared behind our bed head. No one was on duty to talk to when we left at 7 the next morning. Please maintain your hotel!
