<item><hotel_name>Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>A Haven on the Harbor</value></title><date>201907</date><content><value>My stay at the Novotel Darling Harbour was welcoming, satisfying, and untroubled. The conventional reception area was jammed with everyone checking in at the same time. As I waited my turn, I was called to a separate reception area in order to alleviate the line. I was greeted</value><value> by an elegant genial middle-aged gentleman who sincerely welcomed me with more than just "Here are your keys." I got the impression this gentleman’s involvement in the process was an exception, yet it was a gesture to accommodate the advent of tired tourists. I truly felt like an appreciated guest as opposed to little more than a credit card and a signature. My room was appropriately cleaned and prepared each day. The bed was pristine, which is most important to me, with a nicely firm mattress and fluffy pillows. The view from my perfect picture window was beyond belief. When I turned out the lights for the night, I reopened the curtains to an astounding silhouette of a splendiferous sunless skyline. Unfortunately, it is not possible for everyone to be on the harbor side of the hotel, but there simply could not be a more commendable view. Lodging in a fourth-floor room may have been a factor in my very serene sleep. The architectural layout of the hotel allowed me to look out of my door, either up to or down upon impressive vantage points; circular tiers above and beneath. Although, the room was not Avant-guard, the carpet was visibly clean, the furniture was practical, with a table and two chairs near the window serving me well for meals and manuscription. A couch and coffee table were positioned perpendicularly to the window for visitors or a “not ready for bed” relaxation. A small refrigerator appropriately stocked with water, wine, tonics, and goodie snacks utilized the diminutive open pantry inside the larger closet area. A coffee pot or tea kettle stood by to be percolated or steeped. The other end of the extended closet space kept an iron, ironing board, regular and clip hangers with enough space to organize a several day’s wardrobe. The small “flat-screen” TV was positioned easily for viewing from most sides of the room. I wish there had been a better selection of television channel offerings, of course one does not travel specifically to watch TV; just saying. The carpark was very convenient for those with automobiles. However, I decided to walk from the City Centre to the Novotel since it was relatively close. I crossed the nearest bridge en route to the hotel and came upon the carpark access. It was precarious finding my way to the main hotel entrance; putting it mildly. For pedestrian-guests who enter by happenstance through the carpark entry, I would suggest more effectual signage that would be more instructive for first timers. When I learned the alternative route over the Pyrmont Bridge, my entrée to the hotel, henceforth, was fine. What made the absolute difference for me was the courteous and competent staff that welcomed me. When a problem arose about a prescheduled tour to the breathtaking Blue Mountains, I was immediately assisted by the concierge to correct the “pick-up” error. My transportation to the performance of “Madame Butterfly” at the Sydney Opera House was courteously prearranged by the hotel staff. Not least of all, was the unerring commission of a driver for an early flight check-in at Mascot Airport. Although Novotel at Darling Harbour’s location is a high tourist area, it is special to be right on the harbor. The hotel is within walking distance to countless restaurants nearby. There are museums, an aquarium, a zoo; all along the wharf, with bistros, bars, cafés, and canteens on the way. You can hire water taxis at certain sites in the harbor. The Sydney Opera house is only a 30-minute walk from the Novotel if you choose, before or after the evening’s entertainment. You can marvel at the late-night glistening harbor, hear sounds of the water in rhythm with your footsteps. The smells of the sea are palpable. I felt very safe walking around the hotel, even on the darker streets approaching the front entrance. Other people were quietly about. On the two-block walk to the hotel from the bridge, there is a convenient store on the corner; it can be a mite “spendy.” Walk down the block a few yards to the grocery store and save and Australian dollar or two. The Town Hall shopping mall is a 20-minute walk and a more upscale mall is in the Queen Victoria building. Sydney proved to be a banquet of nature, natural harbors, scenic wonders, yet cosmopolitan with blushes of yesteryear. My seamless stay at the Novotel was a befitting respite. The hotel provided the comfort-factor necessary for my energized exploration of New South Wales. I would not hesitate to stay at the Novotel Darling Harbour again.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name>Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Decent hotel in top Sydney location</value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>The Novotel comes across as a decent hotel,  perhaps a little lower by TripAdvisor rating than it probably deserves.  Location -  Hotel is in a top location where you can access many activities and attractions without needing a taxi  -  pass the "foot test" -  Nearby is a</value><value> connected shopping centre with some decent food outlets both economical and upmarket , convenience stores, chemists and so on. - Walking distance to the convention centre (few minutes) - tourist attractions such as an aquarium, maritime museum and more can be found - This is a great location to be based if either visiting for holiday or here on business and appreciate some close by activities when back from work  Hotel Itself -  Concierge and main restaurant are located on the first floor with decent views and spacious interior design -  Breakfast buffet was solid, with a lot of varied choices and a great view of the harbour from most seats. (good range of healthier options) - Front desk service was helpful - Service at breakfast bit below par from top tier hotels who take coffee/tea orders for their barista and clear dishes quickly,   Felt more "self-service" from a service point of view.   Room -  Stayed in a harbour-side room and as you can see from the photo , its a beautiful view -  Room was quiet, Decor was modern though not anything wow -  Bathroom modern though step in bath/shower not my favourite combination - Amenities a bit below par,  no bathrobes or slippers, no complimentary water,  mini-bar was not restocked the next day - TV channels come with standard free to air with a mix of pay TV. I found some of the pay TV channels losing signal at time. -  As a business traveller, the lack of a dedicated desk/work-space meant using my laptop on the bed.   May be worthwhile asking if there are desk options if you need to work during your stay  Overall a solid hotel, not necessarily the most premium experience in this location but one where if you are travelling for business it will be comfortable.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name>Little Albion, a Crystalbrook Collection Boutique Hotel</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Stylish boutique hotel</value></title><date>201906</date><content><value>This is a charming little hotel in historic inner city Surry Hills, about a half hour walk from the central CBD area.The building itself is a former convent which has been tastefully renovated with loving attention to detail. The design aesthetic is kind of contemporary art deco</value><value> and it's all very attractive.  Our room, a King Master, was a reasonable size, cosy, well-appointed and comfortable. The marble bathroom was lovely, with a great rainfall shower and fragrant Molton Brown toiletries. There was absolutely no street noise, which allowed for a good night's sleep. Always a bonus!  Hotel rates include a very good continental breakfast: juice, muesli, granola, yoghurt, fresh berries etc. Another great feature which we made use of was the honesty bar, which has a decent selection of spirits, wines, beers and snacks.  Overall, staff were pleasant and helpful, the room was lovely, and the public areas comfortable and appealing. I would certainly recommend staying at the Little Albion.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

Interiors throughout were great, smart design and everything considered.   Rooms might be thought of as on the small side but the great design made it feel spacious.  We had loft 404, and it was very comfortable.  Great location city wise, parking down the street.

We checked in 4 hours early and our room was ready but maybe just because of time of year? Hotel seems nice enough, our room was on the rear of the building</value><value> over looking a school field, noisy during the day but quiet at night. The gardeners decided however to cut the grass at 7.30 am and school activities start quite early so don't expect much of a lay in. Room is very compact and could use some additional shelving or storage especially in the toilet room.The king bed was massive and very comfortable though. Shower is nice and big, almost half the size of the toilet room easily big enough for two. Staff seem friendly and helpful even new staff being trained as we checked in. If you don't mind a short walk from the city and up hill this is a nice little place but not convinced for disabled/ special needs guests.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

There was also a television and free air</value><value> conditioning The bathroom was very modern and roomy. The maids do a wonderful job! The outside of the building could be called "quaint" and retained it's character well. The wifi was always available and free to use in the bedrooms, downstairs in the lounge and terrace. There are restaurants and cafes nearby. The train station is an 8 min walk away but that does not take you directly into the centre of Sydney. Instead we walked each day through the Botanical Gardens which was very pleasant. I would gladly stay here again</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

The worst part was the bed.  It was a trampoline.  Firm without any support and extremely bouncy so each time either of us rolled over or moved it not only woke your partner but yourself.

I love the service, details and care of the staff. I have been in travel industry since literally last century and have seen different booking systems, processes and attitudes. This process was not from the contemporary world. There was a person on the other side responding to my calls and emails. Emails were not copy-paste instruction type. When we arrived there was champaign on ice and a happy anniversary card in the room. I knew exactly where and what room we were going to have. It was great first impression that lasted up until the last second of our 5 day stay.  As for location, it is probably on of the top ones in Central Sydney. 5-7 min walk to main harbours. Sydney Bridge is just a few hundred steps away. Good restaurants, bars and markets are here.  The only down part was the construction that was going on in one of the streets, but the staff recommended the room on the other side of the hotel.

This place is clean with comfortable beds, no mold in the shower, first class linen and a great view over Hyde Park. Room has a balcony so we didn't feel hemmed in. The room felt open and airy and had a small kitchen. with all</value><value> of the amenities. Its just across the road from Museum train Station ($17 ea fare and a 10 minute or so ride from the airport))The front office staff were friendly and welcoming. Reading some of the reviews here, I fail to understand how some people weren't happy and gave a moaning review. I guess that they may not be happy in life either. We went in with a smile, got a smile back and left with a smile. For dinner we walked a block up Elizabeth Street to the Crown Hotel. Cheap and well presented meals. We will now use Hyde Park Inn as our regular base when we come to Sydney. We highly recommend it. Oh! and the only niggle was that very occasionally we could hear the plumbing which sounded like someone dragging furniture in the next room but it was occasional, lasting for about 5 seconds at a time but was infrequent enough not to worry us.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name>West Hotel Sydney, Curio Collection by Hilton</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>It's Does The Job, But Does Not Stand Out</value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>I'll be really honest with you, this is a hard review to write. It's hard because whilst the hotel is new, in a great location (if being near Darling Harbour and the Northern end of the business district is important to you), its clean, has comfortable amenities, and has a</value><value> certain charm to its design, that is where it sort of ends. There isn't anything that stands out about the property, and that is a real shame.  I've read some of the other reviews to make sure I wasn't missing something. Sometimes staff members have bad days, and sometimes you end up with an average room (even as an Honours elite member), but everything I've read all seems to add up: The service is inconsistent, the rooms are tiny, those bathroom doors are plain weird, and there isn't a whole lot to say this hotel deserves the 'Curio' branding.   I look at Curio and M Gallery by Sofitel as kind of the same thing. If this were an M Gallery there'd be a quirk, a signature service, a very cool 'speakeasy' style bar concept that does happy hour, something that doesn't make it feel like an upscale Holiday Inn, which I'm really sorry to say this does.  Front desk staff should get more training. They should also wear name badges (seriously?), and be more welcoming. We stayed on a quiet Sunday night when nothing else was open at that end of town and we felt like we were kind of intruding on the team.   Look, you won't want to walk out in despair. This is a perfectly good standard hotel that should largely be viewed as an overnight business hotel. I wouldn't recommend it for families or luxe weekend getaways but it is absolutely fine. I'm staying again next week, so it can't be all that bad, right? :)</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name>West Hotel Sydney, Curio Collection by Hilton</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Nice &amp; comfortable hotel</value></title><date>201906</date><content><value>I stayed here a couple of times in one week and enjoyed this hotel. I normally stay at the Hilton Sydney, and am pretty loyal to Hilton hotels over many years, so thought I would give the West Hotel Curio a go.  The design/style of the hotel is really excellent. All areas of the</value><value> hotel are really ascetically pleasing, and the rooms while small, are really comfortable and stylish. So I enjoyed my stays here and will definitely be back.   As it is a Hilton family hotel, the staff are well trained, and service is good. It is a very pleasant and comfortable hotel to stay in.   I haven't previously stayed in this part of town, and found it interesting, The Rocks and Quay are within walking distance, and immediately around the hotel are a lot of shops, bars, restaurants &amp; mini super markets, so it is convenient for travellers. From Wynyard train station is quite manageable with a suitcase with wheels - as long as you don't have a lot of luggage.  I wouldn't really expect to get a view from rooms at this hotel --- except perhaps for some rooms in the suite spot gap on the Barangaroo side. The hotel is only 8 floors and all the buildings nearby are much taller.... So if I was staying again I would just book the Atrium or Banksia -- not the other room types.  While I really like this property, and will be back because I enjoyed the hotel and like a change, I still think the Hilton Sydney probably offers more amenity at a similar price, and as that hotel starts on level 20 all the rooms will have better views. For Gold or Diamond members the Hilton Sydney has an executive lounge, and you would get a minimum of a Deluxe room which has a bath tub also. Suites at Hilton Sydney are also better value as they are normally on a corner, larger, and include executive lounge access for a similar price to the West Hotel Curio suites.  So I will probably still chose Hilton Sydney as my go to hotel, but will be back to the Curio also as it is a very enjoyable and a refreshing change.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

To the manager’s credit, he told me people hate this room, but it was the only one left in that category. (They are recategorizing the room to a lower class next month. I’m not sure why that intel was supposed to make me feel better.) He showed me another suite, but that was simply a larger loft with the same green carpeting. I opted for less astroturf, than more.  As a very frequent traveler and a Marriott Ambassador Elite, the experience is disappointing. I’m here for three nights, so at least I won’t be compelled to stay in my room... rather I’ll explore Sydney instead.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

Its foyer is a botanical oasis making you forget you’re so close to the hubbub.. the stand-alone bathtub in our suite is irresistible. After dropping our bags we hit the streets around Barangaroo for a late night feed. Its 8.45pm on a rainy night and the main drag of eateries is heaving with activity. This is a pocket of Sydney that has gone from zero to 100 overnight.  We take a seat at a  Anason, a Turkish restaurant with an imaginative menu. No need for a  taxi, its a five-minute stroll along the wharf back to the hotel and we need the exercise after that meal.

Sitting on the roof top with the</value><value> board and wine looking at the harbour bridge and circular quay was a great way to end the day.   The prices on alcoholic beverages where a little high, but it is Sydney after all.  The rooms nice size and great to be able to open windows to get fresh air. It was cold on our stay and was nice to walk into a warm room.   We used shared bathrooms and found the 1 st floor a little small, but the second floor bathroom very spacious.   Having the elevator to all levels was ideal for us as I have a spinel injury and hubby bad knees. Although there are a lot of stairs through the hotel maze, which just adds to the character. But I would not recommend the hotel to people with serious disabilities as you do need to navigate stairs.   The staff were very helpful with our bags and arranged pick up transfers for us to airport and the man that does the transfer service so friendly especially at 5am.   The beds where very comfy for us two and sleepy like a baby.   I am a psychic and had a encounter in the push bar and in our first room, room 12. Very pleasant experience too from the spirit family that visited.   - [ ] The Russell hotel 4th August 2019.   - [ ] Room 12- [ ]   Had a visit from:-   ] Mary-Ann   - [ ] Mary-Lou  - [ ] Joanne   - [ ] Other names given which I suspect are surnames:  - [ ] Revesby and Appleby  - [ ] Visions:  - [ ] Mary-Lou : most clearest and pro dominant.   - [ ] Teenage years - [ ] Brown Curley wavy brown hair - [ ] Middle class - [ ] Bonet with ribbon  - [ ] Brown eyes - [ ] Was a person who looked over others in her family and worked as a seamstress with a younger sister.   - [ ] Was shown a small family with a female with similar wavy curly hair although blonde and was looking over all the girls like a big mother or sister. No males present. Possibly was allowing these woman to board, but got the impression family.   - [ ] Mary- Lou : I believe to be the younger sister of Mary-Ann. Very similar features but blue eyes. Never really wanted to show herself, just wanted to be acknowledged. Was too busy seaming and worried about getting in trouble for not getting it done.  Was not very happy, sort of sad.   - [ ] Joanne: did not wish to show herself, just wanted to make sure everyone was doing what they where supposed to do.   - [ ] The push bar: when sitting there was given a message from spirit saying murders.

Rooms are great we chose with ensuite. They had put us together at one end of the building so we could gather as a group on the verandah, enjoy the sun , sunset friends and some refreshments.  Dinner was pizza ordered from manly and delivered to our room.  Day 2 was a walk around the grounds, explored the museum,had our unlimited free tea/coffee from the barrister.  That night we had drinks and dinner at the boiler house, followed by a ghost tour.  I've eaten all over the world in many good restaurants but this one surprised me, the meal was fantastic with every dish varied and if such high quality.  As a person who has trouble knowing my own spirit, I didn't have any ghost encounters but the tour guide was enthusiastic, maybe too many stories of why happened last tour last week.the history side of the tour was very interesting.  Back to the rooms for to finish of our supply of refreshments.  3rd day we walked north head, viewed a whale in the distance.  Check out was easy as our ghost and VIP package included all drinks consumed the night before.  Bus to manly and a walk to shelly beach, finished of the long weekend before the ferry and train home.

We had previously done a ghost tour in</value><value> summer and this time came back to stay and did a smaller tour in the daylight.   Accommodation was excellent with clean and spacious rooms that had a view towards Balmoral Beach and Sydney Harbour. You can either do nothing or we caught the ferry to Manly and walked back via North Head - somewhere we had never been before - where we ran into an Echinda near one of the Quarantine Station's old cemeteries.  Recommend this as a short break if you like the bush  to sit on your balcony watching the boats on the harbour or to be more active as we were and explore some of the natural beauty that was right on our doorstep as Sydneysiders.  Breakfast was included and was excellent and fresh with a good variety, most of what you would expect  at a hotel breakfast buffet.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

If you tick yes to both these then look no further than the Bondi Beach House. It is short walk to the main beach front strip of Bondi and from there all of Bondi is within easy walking distance, the beach, restaurants, cafes, shops, the lot The  longer majestic coastal walks , both north and south, begin and end here too. The accommodation is spotlessly clean and full of Aussie beach side character. It is not an impersonal 5 star hotel but an intimate personal home of your own for as long as you stay.

It turned out she wasn't doing anything. Poor service again, no apologies for the wait either.I would not rush back to this hotel.

The apartment had huge glass</value><value> windows with a stunning view of the harbour, Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge. The apartment itself was large with 2 bathrooms and king beds in each room. The decor is a little outdated, as is the carpet but it’s acceptable. The kitchen was well equipped and there was a large 6 seater dining setting.   The indoor pool is a nice area, no food or drinks are allowed. There’s also a gym and sauna. The bar area is a bit disappointing, mainly because there’s no view.  Breakfast was very good and included barista made coffee.

<item><hotel_name>Harbour Rocks Hotel Sydney - MGallery Collection</hotel_name><hotel_star>5</hotel_star><title><value>Off the Mark</value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>I had high expectations for this apparently five star property, but it missed the mark on a number of fronts:  - The first room I was given wasn’t clean. There were hairs all over the bathroom. Not to mention that the view was a wall...  - I was transferred to another room, only</value><value> to find luggage from the previous guests in the room. This room also hasn’t been cleaned properly - I found items under the desk from previous guests, the carpet on the floor is stained in several places, the shade was broken, etc. The wine glasses in the mini bar were filthy, and I never managed to get them replaced - I had to walk down to the bar myself to get a clean one...   - When I flagged concerns, the desk staff apologized and offered me wine, but didn’t take adequate corrective actions.   - On my last full day, I returned to my room at 3pm after being out all day, and it hadn’t been cleaned. I needed a nap so didn’t bother asking for service, but I then got a call from reception saying that they had SEEN THE DO NOT DISTURB SIGN and decided to call (disturb) to ask if I wanted my room cleaned at 4:30pm...  Other notes: - The area is noisy and the hotel isn’t soundproofed. You could join a conversation with the folks on the street without much effort.  - Some of the bathrooms are so small you’d have to bend your body to wedge yourself between the toilet and the sink.   Basically, this is a nice property that is badly managed and poorly maintained. They seem to be understaffed, undertrained and broadly underperforming. For the price, you don’t get quality, space or service you should expect for a property like this. There are better options in this great neighborhood.

<item><hotel_name>Harbour Rocks Hotel Sydney - MGallery Collection</hotel_name><hotel_star>5</hotel_star><title><value>Cute heritage character, great location - but superior room not so superior</value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>The hotel is gorgeous, has lovely character and the staff are welcoming and helpful. The location is brilliant for getting around the city, so close to The Rocks, Circular Quay and all sorts of attractions.   Unfortunately, I was very unsatisfied with my room. I paid a little</value><value> more for the "superior" room which was not at all up to that standard. Firstly, it was located immediately adjacent to the stairs for circulating up and down to the lobby, right next to the bathrooms for the restaurant/bar and of course, right next to the very noisy bar. The room had little to no sound-proofing so both of my nights' sleep were terribly disturbed. The room is also essentially internal with a french door (you couldn't open) to an internal courtyard - not at all like the superior room pictures shown on the website which are light and open and spacious. The first night I just put up with the disturbance, the second night I asked what could be done to improve the situation and the offer was to shut the restaurant doors at 10pm. I rang concierge at close to 11pm and asked for the doors to be shut. This was done promptly, however just as promptly the doors were opened again and people were coming and going. I again asked for the doors to be shut which again, helpfully they were. Sadly, people still needed to come and go to the bathrooms and up and down the stairs so the night was still terribly disturbed. I was really disappointed. On check out the following day, I discussed this with the lovely staff who were apologetic but since my room had been pre-paid could offer nothing substantial to off-set the terrible amenity of the room. I do think both staff went out of their way to provide an apology - with some free product from the in-house range of toiletries and a coffee - which was really lovely. My feedback to them was not to call that room superior for future reference.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

We accepted the advice of our travel agent Trailfinders, in choosing all our accommodation, including this hotel.  The Harbour Rocks is in a fantastic location, as it is a couple of minutes walk from</value><value> Circular Quay, the centre of transport for boats, buses and trains . The bridge and the Opera house are within ten minutes walk and there are many restaurants and shops in the area. The staff were really friendly and helpful and couldn’t have been more accommodating. The hotel was originally a tea warehouse and has been refurbished very tastefully. It is not modern or glitzy but is full of character. I don’t think there is a lift, which could deter people with mobility issues , but we would highly recommend this hotel and would be delighted to Stay in the Harbour Rocks should the opportunity ever arise again.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

I was told a $24 fee would be charged for two extra hours!! 10am checkout moved to 12 noon? I thought that was silly and a shame.

Ruined our first visit to Sydney</value></title><date>201907</date><content><value>*I could not find my Google review so I am re-posting this here to help others.  Do not book here. We had a terrible experience at this hotel. As the other bad reviews have mentioned, they have a pretty rude and unhelpful staff.   My daughter used her Agoda account and paid for</value><value> this booking in full via Paypal prior to our trip.   During check-in, they informed us the twin bedroom can only accommodate 2 pax, which we completely understood. So my daughter booked a room in a hotel nearby. My wife and I agreed we will stay at this hotel since it was already paid.   The receptionist then asked for a credit card for the $5 security deposit. We gave my wife's credit card instead since they only accept Visa and Mastercard. (My daughter's card was EPS/Cirrus.)  Once the card was charged successfully, the receptionist gave us the keys to our room. After 20 min, the receptionist called us and told us we need to modify our booking.  We were told even though the room was already fully paid and we provided a working credit card, the booking name has to match the credit card's or they will kick us out.  We were shocked. We can't believe they're doing this over something so trivial!  They could have very easily made this edit in their system. But no, they refused to do that. They made us jump through hoops and contact Agoda ourselves to modify the original reservation.  Agoda was confused too and told us the hotel could have easily done this on their end.   Their lack of "common sense" or helpfulness was truly astounding to us. We've stayed in many hotels around the world and this was the first time we've been treated this way.   They said in their ad they treat guests like family, but that could not be further from the truth. We've honestly never felt more unwelcomed in any establishment.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

Everyone in this hotel was really friendly, and I mean everyone.  I was not expecting this in a business hotel in a large city.  It made for a very enjoyable stay.  The food in the executive lounge was excellent.  We had enough for breakfast that we didn't need to have lunch, and the hors d'oeuvres were so filling we had no need for dinner either.  So we never got to try any of Sydney's restaurants!  This was just fine with us and we were pretty tired after walking and sightseeing all day.  It was so easy to just get on the elevator and go two floors for dinner.  The location worked very well.  It's near the train station, so we had an easy trip from and to the airport.

Receptionist, Soo Yeo did a fantastic job with my check in and was very informative and pleasant with our interaction.   The room was of a decent size for 2 people and was</value><value> spacious when we had a couple of friends join us for in-room dinner. Relatively clean room, however, the cabinet above the minibar was highly dusty and the chromes in the bathroom had heavy visible smudges. Bed was comfortable, pillows were very flat, collateral in the room looked worn out. The minibar could have benefited with instructions on how to open it. Air conditioning control panel was difficult to operate.  In-door pool locker room and pool seatings looked abit unkept.  Alysium Spa was a standout, Oceane was very helpful and accomodating when making inquires. The spa treatment was very enjoyable and highly recommended.  Food from room service was amazing. We ordered 4 main dishes and 4 desserts and I must say it was the highlight for everyone. Unfortunately 2 items of my breakfast was incorrect, however we didn’t have enough time so we let it pass.  We were given a complimentary 12pm check out, however just abit after 11am, Housekeeping rang, knocked and opened my room door. No ones fault, better communication was needed.  For a 5 star hotel, it is worth the money to stay here. Close to main locations within Sydney and the CDB.

Bondi Backpackers is a young hostel, but very social and clean, with an incredible view of Bondi beach across the street.  As of August</value><value> 3, the hostel is still under construction (as it is being fully updated and remodeled) but the final work is mostly cosmetic, such as painting. Unfortunately, the workers do still start early (7am) and can be loud in the hallways but most of the really dirty obtrusive work is done.   Compared to Wake Up Sydney and Wake Up Byron Bay, the hostel is snug on space, which comes with the location and view.   My only issues were that the kitchen can be REAL SNUG during meal times to cook and eat, and that the food storage was never checked or cleaned out so finding a locker for dry food could be tough. As someone who is working remotely during part of my trip, I would have also liked more table seating to work. Both the downstairs common area and the 4th floor have none of that indoors, and during winter sitting at the table outside could be too chilly.   Staff is nice and helpful, and the rooms have good storage and plugs/lights by each bed, a must!  Overall, would stay here again and would recommend it. Once the construction work is finished, it will be a really nice hostel option in Sydney.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

We did not get an upgrade as is protocol with</value><value> platinum nor were we afforded anything else. We got a room with a view of the front check in area then again there is construction on the water side, spice your option. The staff while cordial, seemed to be all trainees. The concierge, or whoever was manning the desk could not recommend any Chinese or Thai restaurants. We found our own. The front desk staff had to keep referring all questions (basic) to the manager. I could not get on wifi, no one could determine why and after much ado they put me on the hotel staff wifi. The room was nice. The bathroom was nice looked like it had one new coat of paint and was awaiting the next coat. They have a candy set-up at reception if you want that. We had the included breakfast and that was more than adequate. We had drinks in the bar, great Bellini and great service. We did use the car service which was also fine but uber does come to hotel.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

The</value><value> breakfast buffet is amazing- healthy, beautiful and lots of variety.  We always end up arriving to Australia early in the morning, hours before the official check-in time. The Langham encourages us to leave our bags at the front desk and head down to the spa for sauna/shower and a swim in the gorgeous pool with its dark blue ceiling sprinkled with little lights so as to resemble the night sky. The hot tub is discretely tucked in the corner and I cannot emphasize enough how good the jets feel after a 24 trip from DC!

The Star apologised that we hadn’t been contacted, and offered a food credit and complimentary breakfasts to compensate. They also sent up a bottle of wine and some chocolates with a nice note of apology when they discovered we’d booked for my birthday.

The room itself was your standard holiday inn, clean and comfortable. The staff were very nice and helpful and breakfast was really great. There's a juicing station where you can juice your own fruits and vegetables and this was a big hit with our kids.   The gym is quite small but functional.  We booked at the last minute via expedia and it took a little while to find our reservation. But once we got to our room we found a complimentary bottle of wine which was a nice touch.  We only had dinner there one night. There were a couple of mistakes with our order and the food was just OK.

<item><hotel_name>Springfield Lodge</hotel_name><hotel_star>3</hotel_star><title><value>Comfortable bed...fresh decor</value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>This place is in an historic row of lodges on Springfield Avenue,Potts Point. The area borders Darlinghurst Rd and Kings Cross once the centre of Sydney night life. Little remains of the hey days when US servicemen on leave from the Vietnam war (or if you are Vietnamese the</value><value> American War) painted the town red here. The lodge has been recently refurbished but the historic bathrooms are "tight" with modern glass showers and toilet and half sink. The room is comfortable and it is all about location. It is a pleasant area to wander with many cafes and eateries of all levels. Choose carefully. There are a couple of excellent food markets in the neighborhood where we foraged rather that frequent resteraunts. The rear rooms are completely away from traffic and there is an elevator to the third floor. 4th floor must walk up the last level. Decor is tasteful. There is a cafe under Reno at the entrance with cosy foyer with comfortable chairs and also tv so you aren't confined to chambers. Staff have been very helpful and generally we wanted a place to sleep so being a bit confined in the bathroom wasn't a big gripe considering the price. Kings Cross tube station is 5 minutes max. And cab to the Quay is roughly $20. I have walked it but cab if I am in a hurry. The desk can arrange a group bus to the airport for about $15 p.p. otherwise is is appx $50+ or - to airport by private cab.  Medical clinic almost next door is handy for emergencies (like a flue shot for recent o/seas arrivals). One could certainly do a LOT worse in the centre of a big city filled with many historical hotels. Sydney does Boutique Hotels very well in these classic gems. It is part of the experience for us as we visit regularly and like space where one of us can pop out for a coffee or stroll while the other recovers from jet lag.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name>Regents Court Sydney</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Great budget accommodation in a central location</value></title><date>201906</date><content><value>These small self contained units are located in the heart of Potts Point. With a Funky restaurant strip in the Ally behind the apartments and Harris Markets (for all your gourmet food needs for a self catered holiday) a few doors up. Kings Cross station is an easy 2 minute walk</value><value> away putting the rest of Sydney an easy and quick train ride away. It is noted in the web site that some of these units are fully renovated and others only partially.  I booked the Deluxe Double Studio and was prepared to spend my 3 nights in a partially renovated unit.  The unit I was taken to was on the 1st floor and although it was obviously freshly cleaned, had a comfy looking bed and renovated bathroom.  The rest of the room looked very tired, with cupboard doors coming off hinges, Lino peeling off the floor, tired old carpet, dining chairs with wonky legs and the room was dark, lacking natural light and had a stale smell.   This trip away was to recharge my batteries from a busy family life and to catch up on some well needed professional development. As I would be 3 nights alone in this room and would be self catering for my meals I new this would put a bit of a downer on my stay.  A quick chat with the reception staff and I was able to pay the extra and upgrade to a renovated room. This room was on a higher level, was light, fresh, airy and fully renovated.  I was very grateful for this as it made for a very enjoyable stay while attending a very intense conference weekend.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

What they never mentioned is that you cant buy that voucher if you check in or</value><value> out outside their reception hours of 9am - 5pm.   I check in around 7pm and checked out around 8am. I called their number, their after-hours person didn't even know what i'm supposed to do with the key to check out, and said she would pass on my contact details to the team who would start at 9am. At 10.30am i hadnt heard anything, (i had paid $65 for parking and had to leave for work already). I called again and this time someone else tells me they dont think there's anything they can do.   Wish i'd booked at Quest, just a couple buildings down the road, was a little bit more expensive per night but they have 24 hour reception and had the same $30 parking voucher deal, so would have worked out same cost and probably better, more comfortable experience.  The room and amenities were fine for the price, cosy and clean and interesting buildling but staff should not mislead people about the parking and should inform them that the voucher is not available if you're not there during reception hours.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

Dom and Enna are very accommodating and friendly. We were given an instant upgrade and an early check-in. They provided lots</value><value> of recommendations from transport to must-visit places. We missed checking that Australia uses a different kind of electrical outlets but our hosts are more than willing to lend use the needed adapters so we can charge our electronics.   Location One of best features of this hotel is its proximity to the city's must-visit spot. A few of these tourist spots are just walking distance from the  Royal Botanical Garden, The Rocks, Sydney Harbour, Opera House, etc. Transportation is easily accessible from trains and buses for public transportation and you can also use Uber, Bolt and taxis whichever is more convenient for you. Restaurants, pubs, grocery marts and cafès are just a few meters from the hotel and you have more than enough options available depending what you're looking for.   Room Amenities Our room is small but very clean including the toilet and bath. It has a minibar, coffee tools and a TV. Considering the low price rate of our booking, I can say that this is already a jackpot!  Overall, this is great place to stay in when you visit Sydney. The fact that the location is very convenient and has access to everything you need in the city for a price so affordable, i highly recommend Sydney Botique Hotel.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name>Ibis Sydney King Street Wharf</hotel_name><hotel_star>3</hotel_star><title><value>Great Location</value></title><date>201907</date><content><value>I just had an AMAZING weekend at this hotel. The Ibis is walking distance from Wynyard Station and easily accessible from Sydney Airport. When we arrived we took the long route from the station which was straight down, the very steep, Erskine Street.  We arrived before 1pm and</value><value> were told we could check-in early which was amazing. (The desk clerk also told us a MUCH faster/easier way back to the train station.) My husband had upgraded our room to a King but it was a lot smaller than what we were expecting. It contained a 'short' king size bed (ridiculously comfortable!), a bench under a narrow window with one chair, an open single closet which also had the kettle in it and a very small bar fridge. The ensuite was also small but serviceable. There was not that much space around the bed and I'm glad we only had one small suitcase each as there wasn't enough room for much more. The floors were wood grain vinyl and not that nice considering it is winter and we didn't have slippers!  There is a bar downstairs in the foyer and a small cafe which is where you get your breakfast each morning. (If you've paid for it in advance) Our prepaid breakfast option entitled us to a choice of three items off the menu. This was then prepared for us and served to us in the bar. Very nice and fresh. On our last day we were leaving early so we pre-ordered our breakfast and this was waiting for us when we came downstairs. (No hot food available at the hour we were leaving.)  The hotel is so close to the King Street Wharf that you probably won't spend much time in your hotel. The Ibis is located on a corner and you can see the wharf from it. You walk out the door, cross a small road, walk the length of one building, cross another small road and you're at the wharf!  The wharf precinct is full of restaurants and bars and really comes alive at night. This is also where a lot of restaurant, tourist and party cruises are based. Most importantly, it's where you can catch a ferry. We didn't use the trains the whole weekend but used our Opal card to catch ferries everywhere!   The staff at the Ibis are very friendly and the location is perfect for a fun-filled, relaxed weekend. Try one of the wharf restaurants for a great meal and jump on a ferry to the Opera House.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name>Hotel Bondi</hotel_name><hotel_star>3</hotel_star><title><value>shame</value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>I want to make a complaint as I wasn't heard last night. I was on my table while my husband and his friends went to the bar to get a drink. When I looked up some guys had taken the heater that was on my table, without asking me. The guy that works there even helped them. When I</value><value> politely asked them to return it they were sarcastic and said no one was on the table - which isn't true.  Then the manager came to me and asked me to stop otherwise they were going to call the cops. I said they could as I hadn't done anything wrong. The cops came, didn't let me explain what happened and just said that I should leave. I want to emphasise that neither my husband not myself were drunk. So I was unfairly treated and kicked out of the premises for questioning some really rude attitude. Not sire why your staff behaved like this and being asked to leave was unwarranted. When my husband came to talk to the guys the manager and 2 security guys came to us. Without asking us what happened they told us to go, to move tables and that we had 5 minutes to finish our drinks and then leave. They didn't bother questioning us, just treated us like rubbish. It was definitely prejudice towards us. They assumed we were wrong simply because we are the ones not from Australia. Ive been living here for 3 years and know how things work;  I've never been so mistreated in my life</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

It felt very</value><value> calm and it was quiet.  The bed was super comfortable, and was a stark contrast to the next night spent on a plane flying home.  The hotel is in a perfect location right across the street from the beach and close to all of the local restaurants and cafes.

The location was perfect and very convenient for close access to the Woolworths Supermarket, Town Hall,  Town Hall Station, the Queen Victoria building and the State Theatre as well as Sydney</value><value> Tower and other sights.  I believe that the Receptionist of a hotel can either make or break their reputation and can affect your overall stay,  as they are the first port of call, so to speak.  Upon arrival, we were pleasantly greeted and welcomed by James, who also gave us information as to where we could go for breakfast the next morning as  it understandably isn’t served at the hotel, but other meals are available in their lounge bar.  As we were on the second floor in a twin share room, the lift was wonderfully quaint and old world, and despite it’s looks, worked very well.  Our room was lovely and very clean, comfortable and relaxing, and no noise could be heard coming from the bar below.  I was particularly delighted to see that there were tea making facilities and a bar fridge. As I have stayed in many international hotels without these facilities, it was a very welcoming sight!  I rated this hotel as excellent because of the service we received, the delightful room, and also the close proximity to everything.  I will definitely stay there again the next time I am in the city.  </value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

There is a Cole Supermarket with a Deli and Bakery located on the lower floor of the World Square Shopping Center.  Overall, the entire staff was very attentive, courteous and helpful to the needs of guests.

<item><hotel_name>Holiday Inn Darling Harbour</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Predictably Holiday Inn, but nicely renovated</value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>I stayed here for a few nights recently while in Sydney on business.  At first glance, I did not realise that the hotel was quite as close as it was to Chinatown, which is not the most elegant part of Sydney.  However, once inside, the hotel is neat and clean. It also appears to</value><value> be recently renovated, which is welcome.  I was upgraded to an executive room which had a bath which was lovely.  I thought that the road noise might be an issue, but that is not the case, fortunately.  It's quiet once inside.  The location means that finding non-oriental local restaurants is challenging.  The restaurant in the hotel provides Western food, but not nicely prepared food.  It essentially a "cheap and easy" restaurant.  The breakfast is served in a restaurant dedicated to the purpose.  Very good coffee, but it can get crowded.  Getting there early is a good idea.  Back to location - there is a tram stop a block away which can lead you to central station.  The hotel is approx 1km away, so sometimes it is quicker to walk.  When walking downtown, the Town Hall stop is a little farther afield.  Overall, I enjoyed the stay and would consider it again.  It's a cheap hotel and fits the bill for a business trip.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name>Holiday Inn Darling Harbour</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Short Getaway</value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>Visit started well. Very warm welcome at reception and offer of a late checkout.  Room was available prior to stated check in time so that was a bonus.  Room was comfortable, well appointed and clean.  Bed was good and the mix of pillows was appreciated.  First day’s breakfast</value><value> was frenetic.  Clearly the breakfast space isn’t big enough to cater for the most popular breakfast times.  The hotel actually has a notice stating the busy times and the potential wait times.  In my view, clients should be able to have a comfortable breakfast experience at whatever time suits them rather than work around the hotel’s short comings in terms of space.  The breakfast choices are good - if you can actually access them without being pushed and shoved around by other guests who apparently have no clue about waiting their turn!  Second day, we went to breakfast early which was a better experience.  However, at these prices, I expect to be able to eat in comfort at a time that suits me rather than what suits the hotel. We ordered room service for dinner both nights.  First night was really good.  Second night was a debacle.  We did not get what we ordered.  I called the room service manager who appeared to be well aware that this was the case.  I stress, the food we got was good...... it it was NOT what we ordered.  The manager agreed to take the cost off our bill.  I appreciate that but I would rather have received what we ordered and would have been more than happy to pay.  It can’t be that hard surely?  As far as location, it was perfect for us as we were attending the boat show.  The room was very quiet despite the location.  We would stay again.  I really think they need to look at their room service and the inadequate space in the breakfast room.  </value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name>Travelodge Hotel Sydney</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Kitchenette in every room </value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>What attracted us to this hotel are:   1) it has an uncommon room configuration - triple room with 3 twin beds.

A microwave oven plus plates, and mugs, give us some</value><value> simple meal options. Most of the time, only higher priced apartment-hotels offer this. There is also an additional sink which can be so useful.   The location at the fringe of the central shopping area can be a plus/minus. If you like quiet, yes. If you hate walking, no.   I must say Sydney feels safe. Although there are a few bars around the hotel, we did not feel threatened even when we were walking back close to midnight.

Firstly, it is expensive for what is delivered. Was living in the past as I had been here many years ago and loved the location, just opposite the beach and close to Icebergs Dining where I had a booking. BUT hard to park in front of the</value><value> hotel to unload your bags and then, they advise the hotel has no parking and you have to drive around a few blocks in major traffic to the local Wilson Parking under the Mantra. Then they advise that Amex has an additional charge of 10% which is huge - used to think 3.5 or 4% was excessive but 10% is extreme. And then find that the room is on split levels with the bathroom separate to the bedroom and living - by this stage, enough was enough and we moved on to the Mantra.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name>Hotel Ravesis</hotel_name><hotel_star>3</hotel_star><title><value>A bar, not a hotel</value></title><date>201810</date><content><value>Ravesis is a bar, plain and simple; their hotel effort is a joke. They have a ‘pokie room’ that allows smoking which permeates the lobby and reception area (nice ‘welcome’ ugh), they play outrageously loud music that literally shakes the building until late at night (thank</value><value> goodness for the white noise app), and basically the staff is grossly undertrained to operate a hotel. It’s unfortunate that all of the money spent on swanky room design and smart branding is for not when you arrive to a sloppy, unmanned desk (and a grouchy bartender with no desire to help), an expensive (overpriced!) “ocean front” room that really just offers a peek-a-boo ocean view down the street and an awkward room with the bathroom on the lower level and the rest of the room above with a steep, winding stairway in between (both inconvenient and semi-dangerous). And a $50 charge for a one-hour late check out request? Um no.  We couldn’t check out fast enough!! Only reason for two stars is that it’s a convenient location with lots of restaurants nearby and the beach is just a short walk. Room was nicely decorated but still overshadowed by negative energy from staff.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

If I chose right, it should allow me to walk to that hotel and then take the train next day to Circular Quay</value><value> – right beside the cruise terminal. I packed a large suitcase with wheels, and a backpack for that purpose. BOY DID I HIT THE JACKPOT IN CHOOSING ROYAL EXHIBITION HOTEL. At the airport I was faced with a bank of ticket machines, but being a slow learner I asked at the booth if I could buy a single trip ticket to Central. She said: “If you have a pay wave card you can just touch on with it here to open the gate and touch off at Central”. Too easy even for me. So in return for “two touches” they took $1 out of my debit card for the trip - and everyone was deliriously happy! A platform attendant explained that I needed to leave the station via the Southern Concourse and out of EXIT 6. Too easy. After stepping off the escalator and out onto the footpath, I looked up and 50 metres across the street was a building identified as ROYAL EXHIBITION HOTEL! I was way too early to check in but sat at a table overlooking the street and read and googled and read until lunch time. The chatter and laughter of staff in the background made it feel like a friendly place to be and the staff were most helpful with my hotel and Sydney questions.  The hotel drink prices were cheap and they have probably a dozen wines available by the glass. I had a sparkling for $6.50 and a nice Chardy for $7.50. You’d be a fussy eater if you couldn’t find your perfect meal here. I ordered the double lamb shank with mash and peas ($26). They were large and cooked to perfection with delicious gravy and the meat just fell off the bones. Sensational. On entering the room, my first thought was “dated”. But if you look past the old timber desk; freestanding wardrobe and drawers, it has everything I’d ever need. The bathroom had been completely refurbished; the bedlinen was crisp and clean and my queen bed room was quite spacious. (Not sure if all rooms are similar) Free wifi had excellent reception. Would I choose this 3 star hotel again? Every time I am in Sydney!

The vanity had a sink without a insert in the bottom of the basin.  If you were to drop something in the vanity it would go right through.  Nothing to stop it.

The microwave was broken and burnt the edges of my dinner while leaving the centre frozen. The toilet seat was broken and slid sideways when sat on. The cold water tap in the shower was broken and needed 10 turns to come on causing the hot water to burn me as it came out instantly. The towels should have been white and soft  but where grey and rough. The bed mattress was lumpy and the pillows were as flat as. The TV reception was shocking but the worst thing was the filthy shower floor. The reception works out of another  Property down the road so there was no one on site to complain to.

I didn't wait for the airline to book me into a hotel as they sent me a</value><value> text saying I could book one myself and be reimbursed up to $150. I was also reimbursed taxi fares and a meal.  I actually ended up booking this place by mistake. I was was in such a fuss that I selected the wrong place on wotif. never mind.  The apartment was $139. Check in was OK. Certainly not unfriendly at all. The desk clerk gave me helpful recommendations on where to get a late night pub meal and a few beers. The building is about 200 metres across the street and then down the road, near the hospital. Needless to say I didn't spend much time there as I was gone by 5am the next morning. One thing I did notice was stains on the ceiling, but the bed was comfortable enough and the shower was fine. The celing fan in the bedroom had little effect, however, even with the air-con cranked up as high as it could go. Consequently I was a little warm during the night, but perhaps it was just me. Overall, no real complaints albeit from such a very small sample.

<item><hotel_name>Darling Street Apartments</hotel_name><hotel_star>3</hotel_star><title><value>Great apartment in Rozelle.</value></title><date>201802</date><content><value>We stayed with Gillian two different times on our trip down under. She has two apartments out in Rozelle for rent. Lots of room, great bathroom and good AC. You are a little ways out of Sydney, but if you walk up to Victoria Road and catch any bus heading into Sydney, it will</value><value> let you off in the middle of the city. Walk up Darling Street until you hit Victoria Road, cross at the lights and turn right. There is a bus stop right there. Jump on a bus, cross over the Anzac bridge, and get off when the bus reaches George St. There will be a Woolworths on the right hand side of you bus on the corner of George St. George St. is under going some construction for their light rail system, but all the stores are still open. If you walk down past Woolworths you are headed for Chinatown. Darling Harbour is only a ten minute walk from there. Lots of restaurants down in Chinatown. It will be on your right when you walk down George st. When you see Paddy's Market on your right, just after you pass Campbell st., you are there. Chinatown is right across the street from Paddy's. Do all your shopping at Paddy's. There are no high end stores, but just about everything you can think of to bring home for souvenirs. There is a big food court upstairs if you don't want to eat in Chinatown. If when you get off the bus and head the other way down George Street away from Woolworths, you will end up in Circular Quay where you can catch a ferry to Manley beach. The opera house is also down there. There used to be a free bus running up and down George St., but with all the construction it no longer runs. Probably a half hour walk down to the opera house and about fifteen minutes to Paddy's from Woolworths. Just a couple of hints when you get to Sydney. Great city and Gillian has two really nice apartments out in Rozelle if you don't mind taking the bus. Use the opal cards she has provided and just put ten dollars on each one at the newsagent you pass on the way up to Victoria Road. They will give you a balance. The fare into Sydney is around 3 dollars each way. A lot cheaper than a taxi which will be at least 20. Gillian will stop by after you check in and give you some helpful hints and a nice bottle of wine. Read the booklets she has provided on the table and they will give you some insight into Rozelle and the history of the building she is located in. Highly recommended.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

What a disapointment ! Paint on the walls is falling appart, mold in every corner of the bathrooms, ah ! The bathroom... It is a</value><value> joke ! Nothing to put your stuff (what are you supposed to do with your clean clothes whilst having a shower ?), only one half-broken sink with no soap, absolutely disgusting toilets where noone ever flushes, piss and toilet paper all over the floor, there's no shower cabins, it's two old school curtains with one giving on a urinal in front of it at 50cm ! I'm not kidding ! So the floor is always soaking in - you don't actually know if it's water or piss... The bath-"room" isn't actually a room, it's built in a corridor ! You can't be at more than 3 people, and you have to bump into each other to enter and get out. It's the door's width !!!  The dormatory rooms... Are filthy ! They are not cleaned on a regular basis. I asked to change my room because when I entered, there was chicken wings, papers, plastic bags on the floor, and, for the winner, a bottle of piss on top of the lockers ! I've then met a bunch of people who also asked to change room because of sanitary reason. The pillow and mattress are yellow, not just a little bit teinted by age, no, like, hasn't been washed/renewed in 30 years-yellow !  Only the rooftop is nice, but it isn't the big fuss it has been written about. I didn't try the kitchen. In order to be fair, I was in a room on the 3rd floor, I had a look at the bathrooms on the 2nd floor, and it was cleaner (no urinals). But still. You'd think, when they advertise "best stay at Bondi", that the standing would be much higher ! They kinda surf upon the reputation of the place to neglect the healthiness of the place. Would have thought to find this in Paris, really disappointed to find it in Sydney.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

And no wifi.</value></title><date>201812</date><content><value>Disappointed with my stay here as Tripadvisor states it has free wifi - however, upon arrival, I was told that the wifi was not working and the closest place would be the bar up the road. If I'd have known in advance I would have not stayed here, as I like to go online the</value><value> moment I wake up and last thing at night (and numerous times in between!). It was inconvenient to not be able to check social media and emails as soon as I woke up. I ended up sitting in the pub up the road for far too long looking for good seats for the concert that I was in town for. The bathroom was also grim. Dirty with a bunch of little flies/midges in the bath round the plug hole. When I first pulled back the shower curtain I was horrified. As an animal lover (even flies), I also didn't want to just turn the shower on and drown them, so it was hard to know what to do! The bathroom floor edges looked particularly dirty and the sink was not very clean. It also had a small blockage so water built up in the sink and took ages to go down. There are 2 other toilets with sinks, although those sinks had no lock on the doors (only on the toilet door, which is separate to the sink), and the door didn't stay shut, so if you wanted to brush your teeth or wipe make-up off in one of the sinks by the toilet it was hard to know whether anyone else might just walk in! One of the sinks (I only went in one of the toilets) had no hot tap, just a gap where it had been removed. The windows were stiff to open/close. The bedroom window was open when I arrived but as it was so noisy outside with the pub drinkers underneath, I chose to close the window, only to then not be able to get it to stay open on its own the next day. The bed itself was nice, and one of the few clean things (along with the towels). The room has an old leather sofa and armchair, but they are so worn you can see some of the inside stuffing through rips. I also looked under the armchair and found someone else's drink glass! The room door creaked every time I opened it. The room was a little dark, but does have a few lights. I didn't try the TV or the coffee/tea at the coffee/tea station. Best thing about the hotel is the location - less than 10mins walk to Central Station. If I go back to Sydney, I would not stay here again. I had high hopes, but sadly, was disappointed.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

A short walk to Kings Cross/Potts Point, and only a few minutes from the likes of Woolloomooloo, Hyde Park, Royal Botanical Gardens and Oxford Street. All of a sudden you might find</value><value> yourself within arm's reach of the Opera House or in the heart of Sydney's CBD. Then of course there's everything in between such as the classic pubs, cafes, beautiful houses and historic buildings.  The hotel is beautifully restored, everything is so clean and it's all in great working order.  Wifi works well, and so does the tv (not something we can always take for granted!).  The staff are friendly &amp; helpful too.  There's not a lot of space in these parts of town, so you're probably best to forget about the car and use your feet to get about - or the easily-accessible public transport options.  The rooms are understandably small, but in my case I had all I needed with a separate walk-in robe and bathroom.  Although the street outside is busy with cars going by so close to the entrance, and with construction taking place directly opposite, it is peacefully quiet inside.  The only noise which may disturb you is the activities of those in the adjacent room - just the other side of the apparently thin walls (eg: taps &amp; running water, heavy feet).</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

Think somebody had a sense of humour with the name - Cityview is only appropriate if you think the city is a concrete jungle - my window looked onto a concrete wall.

Everywhere else we have stayed in Aus we received a friendly reception and great customer service. Here is not the case! A man greeted us who instantly looked</value><value> like he was annoyed by our presence, hardly said a word, showed us to our room in haste and then practically ran out before we could ask any questions.  I noticed that the cleanliness was poor, particularly in the bathroom where there was hair and dirt on the floor. There were also marks on the sheets and the cups and plates and cupboards were not clean. The shower (which was tiny) had a door that did not slide properly and we could not close. We paid for an executive apartment so this was not acceptable. Upon mentioning this to the same man the next morning, he stormed off to our room with me practically running behind him, went straight to the bathroom and "fixed" the door after an evident struggle. He then had the audacity to tell me I had to be careful with it rather than apologising for it! He then looked at the floor and said he couldn't see what I meant about the dirt. I literally moved it with my sandal in front of him. He said the tiles are old so look dirty??? Then stormed out again without another word.  If you want to stay somewhere with appalling customer service where you're made to feel a nuisance for even being alive, stay here.   Such a shame as it was a lovely style of room (if only it was properly cleaned) and in a great location. But people should not be running the place who clearly hate dealing with customers.

<item><hotel_name>Billabong Gardens</hotel_name><hotel_star>2</hotel_star><title><value>Bizarre place</value></title><date>201902</date><content><value>Pretty much the worst hostel I have ever stayed in. I’ve stayed in dozens. It’s very very odd - and people who stay for more than a little while realise all the weird strange behaviour - almost felt like witchcraft - going on in this place. Bullying staff and management,</value><value> actually emotionally abusive. The decent one or two staff members don’t know how to handle the crazy staff.  Staff play mind games with guests, varying between being your best friend and your worst enemy, keeping everyone off kilter and on edge. If you have any sense of vibes, you will immediately pick it up - if you don’t, you’ll figure it out. Lots of weird quiet guests in the shadows, saying really strange things to people, lots of mind games - and the management kick out anyone with no notice or explanation - about 10 people kicked out over the course of 2 weeks for having harmless fun or “not telling, just go - rumours”. Then they struggle to fill the beds, so they have heavily discounted rates. No other hostel I have ever been to engage in such bizarre high school power dynamics. Basically they just let guests sort things out and don’t do endless rumour and innuendo.  Takes a while to figure out, as there are one or two of us groups who have all the fun. The staff get uptight and close up any social outdoor seating and the tv room after about 11 pm. Even if you’re not disturbing anyone. You have to wait till they go home, but they make sure everything is locked up so that no one can actually relax. Then, they go around blacklisting at other hostels anybody who says that they want to check out early, or who they kick out, to try to prevent them from checking in anywhere else, even if they haven’t told them what is supposedly done wrong. That’s how insane they are. Or for minor misdeamnours. The hostels humour them, and then ignore them.  Many guests left early as they felt uncomfortable, several of my mates left, we all went to a hostel elsewhere and relaxed and laughed and felt way better - the other hostels had all heard of Billabong and laughed when we mentioned it, their reputation as the last place to be for travellers precedes them.  Guests are aggressively threatened and rebuked for peacefully congregating one minute, and then sidled up to the next, very strange. Then, they will be smiling and collecting stories on somebody else and threatening them. It’s just a very strange place. Most who say “it’s great!” stay short term before they realise.  All outdoor areas are smoking and staff flaunt the no smoking section of the outdoors, so everybody else does, too, which is great if you are a chain smoker like most of us and sucks if you are not or are tying to give up - absolutely no chance in this place.  Kind of smelly, dark rooms and cramped bathrooms, too, with no privacy or space to put anything. Gendered bathrooms with no transfriendly signage. Not a diverse place at all. Never any soap in dispensers. PS don’t believe the reviews on Hostel World as they are are not independent and reviews can be changed or deleted by the hostel.  Their response will come in hard for as much deflection and excuses and projection that they can because that’s what they do.

We wanted an apartment near Randwick racecourse for a short trip in a Uber. We chose the AEA Coogee View apartments. We were greeted with a smiling helpful welcome. Our apartment on level 7 had 3 bedrooms, one</value><value> with ensuite and  then another with separate bathroom. The beds were a good size, very comfortable with fresh white bed linen and the spare room we didn't use had two large single beds, great for kids or another couple.  This apartment had a great view and everything for a short or longer stay. The close proximity to everything was the bonus, Coogee to Bondi Coastal Walk, Coogee Bay Hotel for dinner and Sports Bar with AFL on the big screen, a restaurant right below the apartments called SugarCane, well patronised, fresh Asian inspired food, wine list and service to die for. It was my birthday and so out the waiter came with dessert with candle and a chorus of Happy Birthday, a surprise treat. Ubers galore as we tripped around over the 3 days and ofcourse the wonderful Winx winning her final run was the cherry on top.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

I felt like a complete outsider as it was full of longtermers who seemed really</value><value> unwelcoming and some even rude.   There also were no signs to keep stuff off the floor, which I understand should be normal thing, but I didn't realize it also means no shoes on the floor. I lost my other pair of shoes as the staff had 'cleaned' them away. So make sure you keep your shoes on the bed or in the lockers!

It has great access direct to the beach across the road. On Friday, reception were very friendly, and helped us out with extra parking, and the bedding was neat and clean.  The</value><value> apartment we were in (704) was very tired, and really needs some work to be at a standard you would expect at the price.  For example, white paint had been lazily slapped on skirting boards, and walls were chipped in various places. Little maintenance taking place.  The lift was jamming consistently (left hand side), and this was concerning us so much we had to use stairwells and avoid lifts (or hope to get the right hand side lift).  There was no one in reception on Saturday afternoon to speak with about the issue.

It was clean, spacious with a large lounge/dining room, large well stocked kitchen including a dishwasher, 2 good sized bedrooms, one with en-suit bathroom, plus another separate bathroom, a</value><value> laundry room with a washer, a dryer, ironing board and iron.  There was a lovely view of the beach both from the small balcony and the living room windows.  It was overlooking Kurrawa Street and we were a bit unlucky in that twice in our 4-night stay, the bins were very noisily collected but, otherwise, it was a quiet apartment, particularly in the bedrooms at the back.  There was a free parking space allocated to the apartment but we did not need this.  Would have been five stars except for the draughty windows.  They are the old fashioned metal type and did not close snugly in places meaning we had to have the heating on a little more than we'd have anticipated.  If it was in the UK I would suggest double glazing.  Only visited Reception once, which is not open 24/7, but found them helpful.  I would certainly return to this apartment and at around £230 per night for such a great location, feel it was good value for money.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

I didn't hear a thing, nor the music from the bar below the place is fairly well insulated for noise from the Bar. For what I needed, it was perfect. The room on the second level was large and clean, had a television and a good shower. I slept through the night, got up early the next morning and tried to leaf. There was no one around, the whole place was closed up.  So you have to let yourself out and leave the key in a handy spot.

<item><hotel_name>Pensione Italia Bed &amp; Breakfast</hotel_name><hotel_star>3</hotel_star><title><value>A bit delusional</value></title><date>201511</date><content><value>We travelled half way around the world to attend a wine festival.  This place was chosen for us because our friends live in the area.  Ok, it is cheaper than places in Sydney, but way too expensive, according to Italian and USA  standards for what was offered.    Welcome:  As</value><value> soon as we arrived, Sig. Alfio asked us for  a downpayment.  We were staying for 10 nights and had just arrived from the airport. We asked if we could give him our credit card.  They don't take credit cards, nor Euro cash. Just Australian dollar cash. He was quick to point out that on the street parallel were several banks and we'd have no problem cashing in our Euros the next morning.   Breakfast:  We asked where the breakfast area was and he said the stuff for breakfast was in the room.  That fact already is more like  a "rent a room" than a B&amp;B. There were items in the room - instant Nescafe, white bread, processed cheese, and water left in the water boiler.  If people are satisfied with those items, then the room does contain breakfast supplies.   Payment:  The following day we asked Alfio for bank details, as we were not going to pay in cash Australian dollars -160 per night for 10 nights (more than 1000 Euro).  They gave us their bank account and insisted that a money transfer was possible without a Swift code. It was our bank in Europe that did the  research to find their Swift code.  After our bank asked them to verify it, the money was sent. In the mean time, he was worried that we wouldn't pay and asked everyday for the money.   The room:  We were two friends and the bed was a place and a half. It would be good for a couple but he knew well in advance we were not a couple.  The room is without a window.  The only window for the bedroom was  a small one in the bathroom above the shower area.  Check out:  At 10.27 on our checkout day Sig. Alfio arrives to ask when we are leaving as he needed to clean - - - for no new guests.  Since our flight, is  at 7:45 pm we asked if we could go out for an early lunch , come back and prepare to leave.  Ok,said Alfio.  however when we arrived the towels were gone, sheets already off the bed and cleaning in motion.  He also took the bootle of water i purchased earlier that morning for my long stay at the airport.  Our colleague also stayed 8 nights at Pension Italia. I would think that paying a total of 18 nights, he could have let us stay a bit longer.   Maria, his wife  is nicer and more welcoming.   Wifi:  Wifi was free and sometimes worked better than others. mostly it was very slow or non existent.   Neighborhood:  The neighborhood was nice and it was easy to get into the heart of Sydney - bus 438. There were nice restaurants and shops on Norton street, one block away. The best coffee in town was just down the street at a cute and cozy shop called Cafein Bar. They served great breakfasts and lunches as well.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

The bar itself is great, huge range of tap beers, good bar meals, and tasty late night toasted sandwiches. Definitely help in keeping your drinking shoes on.   Late night bar, no lock out,</value><value> and as we were staying there 10% discount on all food and beverages.   The rooms are very basic and suited our needs fine. The shared bathrooms on each level while old style were clean, the water was hot, and had decent pressure.   For a short term stay and only using the room to sleep the Keg and Brew is a great place.   The location is ideal for Sydney. A few minutes walk to Central Station. A Tab, chemist, supermarket, and a variety of eateries all in walking distance makes the Keg and Brew a great place for a short stay for a boys/girls weekend away.   Great value for Money in Sydney</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

The place is very well located close to shops, restaurants, bars, central station and bus stops. Very close to Sydney's CBD and to the harbour via public transport. Small woolworths food</value><value> market and a Coles supermarket available nearby walking distance. The apartment is fabulous!!! We stayed in the 3 bedroom penthouse with beautiful views, very spacious, very well furnished and equipped. Just like in the website's pictures, they are all true. Find the description directly on their website.  Apartment is equipped with a full laundry wich allowed us to travel light knowing we would be able to wash clothes, and washing soap is even included. The kitchen is completely equipped as well, with anything you need from dishes, pans, pots, cutlery, glasses, fridge, stove, oven, tea kettle, etc. You even get a microwave and a bread toaster. You don't have to buy anything for your stay as the property includes dishwashing soap, paper/cloth towels, tea bags, coffee, etc.  The apartment is impecable. Everything in top maintenance and working conditions (surface finishes, applicances, bathrooms, lighting, carpets, etc). Beds and pillows super comfortable, they really help you sleep well.  You won't find any stains, funny or bad odours, and the best of all...no noise!! It´s really quiet, windows block outside noise very effectively, and even the air conditioning/heating system is reeeeeaalllly quiet. About temperature, we could very effectively control it to our needs. Although all communication is digital (no personal contact) the manager Suzanne Wood was really helpful and kind to me, solving all my issues. I'm glad I chose this hotel for our 12-nights long stay. If I'll ever go back to Sydney I'll definitely come back to this place!!!!!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

Yes, it was on New Years Eve, but we did sleep with our windows open, the rest of the week was fine with us getting some good sleep Zzzz's in the bank :) Apartment size is perfect for couples, a squeeze with children but we weren't there to sit around the room - we were off on a Sydney adventure, and that we did in one of the best locations on offer - Manly - beach on one side, harbour the other - just perfect.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

I Understand New Year's Eve and New Year's Day would be expensive, and I have no qualms with that at all. After all, that is the two nights I wanted to book and the reason I was in Syndey. But to stay on those days I HAD to book 5 nights at the extortionate price even though after the 2nd the price went right down as these are just see as 'any' night now the nye celebrations were over. That said, I was still paying more than 70$per night extra (110$ per night In total) for a  bunk bed in the exact same room others were paying as low as 30$. I know this becuase I spoke with my room mates and couldn't believe it. I went to speak with the manager named Bruce and he just spoke down to me as If I was stupid. I felt absolutely robbed, especially because the 'deluxe' room had absolutely no circulation, smelt bad and was hotter than a sauna. The shower was hot and cold; hardly deluxe. And if that wasn't enough, my food was stolen from the fridge. Easily one of the worst places I've stayed in the entirety of my 6 months trip. Absolute rip off.

I've stayed twice here - the</value><value> first time on my own in the room with private shower which was great.  The second time with my son in the family(?) room.  I'm picky about the cleanliness of showers and toilets, so I'd probably rethink where to stay if I couldn't get the private shower room!  Location is great - but parking is nigh on impossible.  We had to take the gamble of getting a fine by parking in surrounding streets but from 7pm to 0830am there's parking in front of the lodge.    I find it a bit disconcerting there are no overnight staff around!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

Had clear instructions all around.   Reception when on duty was very nice and smiley. If had any enquires before hand by email was always quite a quick response :)  The kitchen area is small but was ok. Free bread, butter,</value><value> jam, cereal and milk, tea, coffee.  There was loads of things cooking facilities to make up something yourself.  The room was a nice size. A dorm of 4 (female) Comfy beds. There was a locker under the bed which is slightly akward to get to and only 2 power stations, one next to someone eles bed and another near the coat rack.  There was a sink in the corner which was handy but was quiet dusty and also on the frame of the beds.   Bathroom / toilet was mostly clean. Plently of toilet tissue. New shower which always had hot water which was a amazing and had a modern fresh look.  Again the sink needs a good clean around it was dust.  There is only 4 showers around so in the morning if your in a rush make sure you add some time on.  Wi-Fi was great. Did not go up to the terrace so can not say much on that.   Overall was nice, good people, wasn't full of the usual crazy young packers. Im 28 and past the time of partying all night. Was able to sleep with no nosie.

<item><hotel_name>Sydney Star Backpackers</hotel_name><hotel_star>2</hotel_star><title><value>Tolerable for the good location</value></title><date>201901</date><content><value>The dorm room is quite a bit more cramped than hostels I've been to before, although for all I know this is normal for Australia. It's not just the square footage either; the way the room is laid out means that you and your stuff are spread across the whole space (towel,</value><value> charging ports, locker, window ledges etc.) and that bags would occupy a lot of floor space (lower bunk too low to have most bags fit underneath), making the place feel more cramped than it needed to be. So, my actual time in the room was not restful. The showers were good, though, and the wait time was not too long.   As I mostly ate out with my local friends (the reason why I chose to have a long transit in Sydney in the first place), I did not utilise the kitchen much. It seemed ok, albeit not too organised or warm in layout.   I might have had a better experience if I had taken a private room instead. Since this hostel is rated highly by other travellers, perhaps this is a normal stay experience for Australian hostels - so, something for more introverted travellers to take into consideration.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

Expect a weird crowd when you are only staying for the cheap price. I was booked in a 12-bed dorm, so I didn't expect much. Still, I was disappointed when there was no place for my bag. They have chests under the bed for each person, but I didn't get one because my bed was in a corner with another bed. Ended up storing my bag by someone elses bed, and sleeping with my backpack in the squeaky bed with me. The kitchen and common areas closes at 9 pm. After that you are not allowed to get your food. You are not allowed to eat in the rooms either. So when I asked where I was supposed to eat my evening meal, one of the staff just shrugged his shoulders and told me to organize my day better. The wifi sucks, and even my phone data gets a bad signal at that place. So be prepared to be sent to bed with no internet at 9 pm. The kitchen is really hot and crowded. They have gas ovens and bad air circulation. Almost got a heat stroke from trying to cook a decent meal. Plus, it is basically outside with the door open all day, so there is a bunch of cockroaches in there. I also smelled weed there every day I was there. I don't mind it, however it just made the other rules look so silly. You can smoke weed all day, but not cook after 9 pm? The rooms have aircon and my sheets were clean when I got there.

That is the only positive thing about this place. kitchen is located in a separate building with wide open doors, so roaches and bugs flourish in the kitchen, literally everywhere. The kitchen is also extremely underequipped, I've</value><value> been here for a month and still have never seen a fork, a cup or a glass. sometimes there are knives. If you don't buy a special fridge bag they'll toss all your food.   The staff is really passive-aggressive, there is no inside area and both the kitchen and the outside area close at 9 pm, but they usually start angrily telling you to go away at 8:30 ish. If you want to eat after nine you have to go out, and you're not allowed to use the outside seating at all after nine. Numerous times I encountered people who arranged to check-in after hours with the reception, they often just don't show so people have to go somewhere else for the night, they don't seem to care at all about their customers. Oh and there are obviously no events or activities.  The wifi is unusable, you can't even bring up a newspage, tried using my phone data - no reception. not backpacker-exclusive so you will have pensioners being yelled at to finish their food at 8:45, noisy nineteen year olds yelling and smoking weed and sometimes children running around all at the same time. Beds are hard and dirty, not enough storage boxes pr. room. laundry has two machines for like fifty people, showers often does not have warm water. Dryers doesn't work, the program runs but it seems it just tosses your clothes around.  Spend the extra 3 bucks a night and go to the YHA, I thought I had low enough standards to cope, but this place is just really bad, all the small things just pile up and annoy you...</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

We stayed for 10 days and I dont think we slept much the whole time. We were located on the first floor and the street  noise is horrendous! Double glazed</value><value> windows may help there! The walls are so thin you can hear the conversations in the next apartment.  For a long term stay one would have expected to maybe get a better deal? The room is in dire need of a revamp, things were broken in the room and cleanliness was only just bearable.   Our bed was changed once during our stay which is fine but they never changed the foldout bed which was being used also. The shampoo, body wash etc ran out within the first day or two and was never checked to top up.  Often the coffee was not topped up either. They only vacuumed once during our stay and that was a day before we left so needless to say the floor was messy but room attendants just left it.   The  roof top pool is good but only went once as you have to walk the last 3 flights of stairs as the elevator does not go to the top so some of our group were elder.  Overall I would stay again because it is a 2 minute walk to Darling harbour but the price is similar to others in the area of better quality lodgings.  The photos on the booking sight must be elsewhere as our room was definitely not that nice. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

I think there is might be a lot of difference between the rooms which, according to the staff, are renovated one by one.  I stayed in a six-person dormitory and was "upgraded" to a room with ensuite bathroom. It</value><value> felt damp during the entire stay despite the fact that there was an air conditioning on. There was also a stale sour smell that might have been drawn into the very grubby carpet. In addition to a large locker, there were no cupboards or surfaces to store items so that the guests' belongings were located throughout the room.  Pros are - Centrally situated. Only 18 minutes walk from Hyde Park and 2 minutes to Supermarket and Metro. - a modest complimentary breakfast (white bread / jam / milk and cerials) - Very friendly staff. - Fridge with freezer in the room.  Negatives: - A portion of the courtyard garden is also used as a recycling center for the neighborhood. This makes the stay in the outside area unpleasant because of the view, noise from the deposit and the stench of the recyclable waste. The entire hostel is dark and old and worn. The common room is in the basement and has hardly any daylight. - Air conditioning has no noticeable effect on temperature or air humidity in the room.-  -Pricey ($35 pppn) compared to the surrounding hostels with better or equivalent facilities. -Low water pressure in the worn bathrooms with lots of mold between the cracked joints.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

I booked a "basic 6-bed dorm" on Hostelworld, incorrectly thinking it would look like the other nice</value><value> pictures of the rooms. It was the cheapest bed in a decent hostel showing on search results, so I thought, what the heck - I'll take it. The room happened to be ok with its own fridge, air-conditioning, lockers and wash basin, but was not so pretty - quite dim with only a tiny window (picture a large-ish basement converted into a cozy bedroom). Fair enough, I made an assumption and paid the price. The slightly more expensive dorms upstairs are a lot better - I got put into a six bed dorm, this one has so much more space and actually looks like the pictures on the website! Bathrooms and kitchen are cleaned regularly but look like they could use a little renovation. From what the managers told me, they are working on this - I wish them good luck.

Towels fluffy and clean. Overall I can’t and wouldn’t fault the room, people , location and price.    It’s a credit to the owner that a standard has clearly been set - and maintained.

Access to the lower rooms at the hostel (where I stayed) was</value><value> either down dark side steps or out the back of the kitchen and down wooden stairs, neither are idea in the dark.

Bathrooms aren’t great, in the girls bathroom only one bathroom door locked, every time someone had a shower the floor in the whole bathroom was soaking!

The kitchen &amp; dining area is a bit small but manageable and the TV room is sociable. I did find it a little strange that there was only 2 toilet cubicles on each floor and 2 showers, if I didn’t have one in the room I could imagine this would be a nightmare.

When she realized it had nothing to do with us and discovered it was an accidental incident by other hostel guests in the room above us we failed to receive any form of apology. For a basic backpacker hostel Ady’s place is extremely overpriced and lacks basic cleanliness and amenities. Our experience was extremely disappointing and not worth the unreasonable expense.

Other must see places such as the Opera House and the Botanical Gardens are approximately a 10-15 minute walk away.

I would of happily given this place a 4* rating however on the last evening before I was going to leave I was walking up the stairs and I saw the BIGGEST cockroach which made me feel ill.

<item><hotel_name>Annandale Hotel</hotel_name><hotel_star>3</hotel_star><title><value>Average. Wouldn't stay more than a few days.</value></title><date>201802</date><content><value>I booked a private double room with an ensuite. It's rather small, and I was travelling with one other person - which made it difficult. If I were to book again, two seperate rooms might be better.  It was alright for staying 2 nights (3 days), but I wouldn't want to stay more</value><value> than that. We stayed on a Thursday and Friday night, and it was LOUD downstairs, however this IS a live music venue and pub, not a standard hotel.  All I needed was a place to keep my belongings for a few days, and to sleep, and I got that - paid a bit much for it, but I got it.  When you are led into the guest side entrance to access your room, it looks rather dirty, pulled up carpet and leaves and dirt all over. Upstairs (I was in room number 2) in our room, there are several things to point out.  1. The windows open, didn't lock, and have no fly screen. If you want them open, you'd have to be there and hope nothing flies or crawls in. 2. The curtains are VERY sheer, almost pointless in having them. 3. The fan was almost covered in dust, which meant we would have to clean it if we wanted to turn it on instead of having the windows open - which made staying cool and issue. 4. There was a room clock, batteries didn't work. 5. The roof was peeling away from the plaster, who knows what was hiding in there? 6. Sheets had a few holes in them, and side table looked as though it had contact over it that had creased. 7. In the bathroom, the shower doesn't have anything on the ground to stop the water from flowing out onto the bathroom tiles. There is a drain, however it sits flat and is not sunken in to help drain water. Which means super short showers unless you wanted a flooded bathroom. Also on the topic of the bathroom - there was no bin, which made being a female a little difficult. 8. It's a SMALL double bed.  Food downstairs is really good! Burgers By Josh have taken over, so if you don't like burgers, you may be out of luck, as they didn't seem to promote having any other kind of food. However the burger was delicious, and it comes with fries (the menu doesn't say so, so I ordered seperate fries and nobody bothered to tell me it came with the burger anyway)  Seems to be only accessible by stairs, so if you are injured, pregnant or otherwise cannot use stairs - this might not be the place for you.   Across the road is a McDonalds (Parramatta road) and across the side road (where the guest entrance is) there is a small cafe with very nice coffee, which was beneficial.  Did not use the communal kitchen or bathrooms, so cannot comment on the matter.   Room had a small double bed, two bedside tables, one lamp, one desk, one chair, one cupboard, one power outlet (near the bedside table and lamp), shower, sink, toilet.  Poor view from the room I was in, in saying that, traffic noise was not an issue, the only noise issue for us was music, however we willingly stayed in a music venue on a Thursday and Friday night - so we expected this.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name>Sydney Darling Harbour Hotel</hotel_name><hotel_star>2</hotel_star><title><value>even before you step through the door they make you feel so welcome and nothing is too much trouble I love this place</value></title><date>201907</date><content><value>It was my birthday, we'd just spent a while in the Blue Mountains with family and now it was time for a three day break at the darling. This has to be my favourite hotel in Sydney It is seldom that not just one but every member of the staff is so welcoming, so helpful and so</value><value> lovely, thank you all so much.   I received as beautiful card from them a bottle of wine, a box of chocolates and a plate of fresh fruit including my very favourite fresh figs..... Now how did they know that! Yes it is part of the  Star Casino but it it is a short distance away from the casino side,  but within the same complex.  There is the Casino hotel and there is the Darling I guess if you want to gamble the Casino Hotel closer, but we didn't visit the casino side sat all on this visit.     Our three days included a fabulous  included a fabulous breakfast, it was all part and parcel of the deal and I can assure you its a great breakfast, if you want to be a bit adventurous you can try their cooked meals as well as the buffet, remember though the name of the restaurant is Sokio so food will be a little different, however, on the buffet side there is just about all you could want, fresh salmon fresh juices, cheeses, salads, danish pastries, croissants  fresh bread or they will toast it for you the list goes on and on. I should warn you however, that it is is so very popular that for breakfast I would suggest getting down way before they close the kitchen, our first day we go were in a queue from about 9.30 and the kitchen closes at around ten I believe, so it was a bit of a rush by the time we got seated and rather noisy, well what do you expect when its so popular and no full!   The second morning we knew better and got down to breakfast around 8.45 there was no queue and we were seated pretty quickly so I guess its ups to you. wait in a queue and be there before the queue.     There was a photographic fashion show going on in the lobby on one of the days we were there, but don't think this is a usual occurrence,  but made good entertainment!  Our room was lovely had everything we needed including slippers and dressing gown  and bottled water.  seriously couldn't fault it apart from our ignorance in getting the right lights to work at the right time and the blinds to open and close at the right time!!   This was perhaps the only negative and I am sure easy to change.  The switches are all on the side of the wall  but  the names are so small and the angle not easy to read that we had to actually use a torch (even with the lights on) to see what lights we wanted down and whether we wanted the blinds up and down.   I am sure part of the would have been our problem as we had family with us and they didn't have the same problem but I can tell you it was a little difficult when switching off the wrong buttons we had blinds down and all lights off!!!! And if I may just add a bit of vanity here....... putting on make up in the morning wasn't that easy, the lights over the two sinks is great, not complaining, but when you look in the mirror, the lights are in such a situation that your head puts a shadow on them and to try to put on makeup or pull out that darned annoying whisker is not easy. I eventually resorted to the large very good hand magnifying mirror which I held close to the window to apply makeup etc.  The rain shower is fantastic, but here again, I did find a slight problem...... when you have used the soap or shampoo, the floor is very slippy I would suggest a slip mat would be a good idea.   However, nothing will ever stop me coming back here...... well, nothing that I can think of at this time.  I love the Darling, love the Staff, love the hotel, oh yes... perhaps a few more selective pillows, we had hard ones and when I asked if I could change them, no problems, but the ones they brought up were either toooooooo soft or latex hard.  I would love a dream pillow.  But still slept like a baby and had a fantastic three days.We have stayed at many hotel in Sydney, and am sure many of them are great hotels, of course they are, but to us, The Darling is our darling hotel, can't think of going anywhere else and the staff are also darlings...

I felt for the cleaning lady as she seemed very stressed and talked about her long hours and poor pay-so I tipped her!! she deserved it. There was a nice cafe attached and buses very regularly from carillon ave and Missenden Rd-3mins walk. 5-10mins walk to King st with plenty of restaurants etc. Location was brilliant really.  However people in unit next door set fire to their unit-lots smoke but smoke alarms DID NOT WORK-hope this has changed.  Luckily it was daytime and another resident alerted everyone.

I'm surprised this building passed planning permission as there is no air vent on the apartment's exterior wall and the only way to get some fresh air is to open the sliding door to the exterior ledge (it is not a balcony as it is only 60cm/2 feet wide) and put up with the incessant traffic noise coming from Carillon Avenue, which makes it impossible to get a good night's sleep. The range hood above the cook top is useless as it doesn't have a chimney connecting it to the building's exterior, which means the cooking fumes are merely circulated within the airless apartment. The bathroom is also poorly ventilated (embarrassing for toilet users) and the hand basin is at an uncomfortably low height (better suited for a child to wash their face in rather than an adult) and the cabinet above it is stupidly oversized. Do not stay in any of the street-facing studio apartments if the overnight temperature is going to over 19 degrees C as ours was an excruciatingly uncomfortable heat box, even with the fan on and the 'balcony' door wide open. The traffic noise was horrendous!  Clearly, there is an urgent need for air conditioning units to be installed as, in my opinion, these appartments are currently unfit for occupation.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

The TV had been taken away, but the TV channel guide was still there. There was an unusual white stain on one of the blankets, was best not to think of what it was. Some of the shared toilets hadn't been cleaned properly. There was construction outside at 3am on a weekend night, very annoying. We parked in a nearby parking garage and the hotel reception was supposed to stamp the parking receipt for a discount, but reception couldn't find the stamp so he gave us a printed receipt, but the parking garage didn't accept anything without a stamp and charged double the price. There's a reason the price is low, they do the bare minimum and give you horrid service in return. Go elsewhere.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

Yes, we booked an extra night before we left home</value><value> as our daughter had a meeting in Sydney. We paid extra for parking but daughter had to park on the street one night as the parking spots were obviously over-allocated. Our daughter's room was better, but complained about people sitting outside her door all night smoking and talking and the cockroaches- the front office lady did something about this early on which was helpful although people still smoked under the outdoor area which came into the room.  She has three small children so was not too happy.   On check out, we were told we had paid our bill all was fine, but when we got home and checked they had charged us an additional $86 including the parking. We will never go there again or refer anyone to the place.  Our son also booked a room on Friday and Saturday nights and he was very hot and didn't sleep due to the bed and the heat from the fan in their room not working.

However, being between Xmas and NYE, it was all we could get.   It claims to be 3 stars, however according to the Australian hotel star classification, it would only be 1, maybe 2 at a</value><value> push.   There is no WiFi unless you're in reception (or very close to) and you get 1 hour free, then it's paid only.   When we arrived, we checked our room to find it a bit smelly, very small etc so we asked for another room but that was exactly the same.   In our room, you could not get to the toilet without first stepping into the shower cubicle, then closing the door before stepping out the shower.   They have taken all toasters out of the rooms so you cannot set off the fire alarm, which is fair enough; however the policy in place is a joke. You have to go to reception and deposit $50 to hire one whilst you make your toast, then return it immediately. This can only be done at breakfast time. One evening after a long day, one of our group simply wanted some toast for tea (this was 9:30pm) but was told we cannot have a toaster at this time because it's 'too late'. Never ever came across this in any hotel, EVER.   We are clearly not the only people to think poorly of this hotel - someone has enscribed 'the worst hotel' on the ceiling above the bunk bed in our room.   Also, there is nowhere really to store luggage.   It's comparable to a hostel, if you were to have a private room.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name>Edgecliff Lodge Motel</hotel_name><hotel_star>3</hotel_star><title><value>Did the job but....</value></title><date>201811</date><content><value>Ill start of with some negatives  Entering the room at check in around 2pm there was a bad stench. Smelt like Asian food that had gone off. Was terrible. I keep a small can of Glen 20 in my backpack and gave the unit a good spray, helped. But when entering the unit later that</value><value> night could smell the stench again, had to Glen 20 again.   Around 430pm had a quick knock on the door and an Asian lady entering briskly. I intercepted her and inquired why is she coming in? Said to give me milk, which I already hade two small cartons in the fridge. This is not a good look and felt privacy may be  an issue here. There is no "do not disturb sign" and you have to question security of the room if you leave to go out. I suggest to Edgecliff Lodge, when someone has checked in, a phone call to the room or a note under the door would be more appropriate than just waltzing in. We want to feel safe and secure, My stay I did not  The bread in the fridge (for breakfast) seemed a few days old. I had a little bit of the fruit bread but couldn't muster it, the white bread was worse. Toasting it would have made it better I guess but couldn't be bothered picking up the toaster from reception and possibly setting of the alarm   Other than the above problems, I found the stay ok. Yes the place is old and some furniture should be replaced. But got a good nights sleep and it ticked couple of the boxes I needed for my stay. There is a sink with small bench and cutlery in the bedroom. There is also free undercover parking, but its limited, maybe 16-18 spots?? If you check in before 3pm id imagine you will get a spot, otherwise you may need to park on the road or side street.  There is Coles supermarket up the road, 5min walk, and a bunch of cafe's and takeaway places as well. Edgecliff train station is in that vicinity as well. The service and friendliness of reception was good  Would stay again, but would definitely check out the room for bad smell before taking the key for the night, as well as bring limited valuables to the room.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

We did meet some very interesting and welcoming people in the tiny common room. The location was bloody fantastic, and the surrounding pubs had awesome happy hour deals ($5 scotch whiskey anyone?).

Awful management.</value></title><date>201906</date><content><value>I’ve been staying at this hostel on and off for a while, everything used to be fine until the management changed recently. Now the new manager (Laura) has changed the reception opening hours to 11;00-14:30 so it is now impossible to extend if you work normal hours, and to top it</value><value> off you will get charged a late fee due to this. Laura has also decided to change the kitchen opening hours to 7am knowing full well that a lot of the tenants here work in construction and need to be able to access the kitchen to grab their lunches etc for the day ahead. The bathrooms absolutely stink and even after multiple complaints off most people staying here the manager refuses to listen, for example there was a leak coming from the roof in one of the rooms the other day, it took 2 days for her to even get anyone round to fix it and meanwhile the person staying in this room had to wake up to her bed/belongings being leaked on. There are some major health and safety concerns that also never get addressed, for example the boxes to store your luggage in, there’s big metal strips hanging off, there was a hole in the doorway downstairs directly as you enter that didn’t get fixed for 4 WHOLE DAYS, somebody hurt themselves by falling through it due to it not getting fixed and still the lack of care from management was unbelievable. be prepared to get kept up past 3am in the morning due to the bar downstairs, again this could be forgivable if they at least had an area for guests to chill and relax, but no they decide to kick everyone out of this space at 10:30pm!! To make all this better the manager struggles to even spell basic English when putting up passive aggressive signs around the place?! And as a result to all these issues, it’s the general receptionist staff that have to deal with all these problems, whilst they are the ONLY thing holding this place together! DO NOT BOTHER TO STAY, you can find plenty of other hostels where the management will at least listen to your issues.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

The reception hours are a huge problem for people who have just arrived in Australia as the reception is only open midday.

We stayed for 2.5 weeks and the toilets got cleaned 3 times max over that period. Leaving poo in the toilet for 5 days and we ran out of toilet paper more regular than the times we had it. (We complained and the reasoning was that the contractors over the festive period have got confused about the shifts during our stay) not justifiable if you ask me.  - Kitchen: the hob and the Oven was turned off during all our stay and therefore we only had the microwave to cook anything with. It was impossible to actually get a full piece cutlery set. There was one fork on the whole premises.  - Housekeeping was poor. Despite being asked repeatedly to change beds and empty bins they still didn’t carry through these actions. A photo attached was one of my friends pillow on arrival.

<item><hotel_name>Glebe Space</hotel_name><hotel_star>2</hotel_star><title><value>Don’t waste your time!!! </value></title><date>201901</date><content><value>How is possible to get something so wrong?!   Let’s start with the good - I stayed in the newer building, in a room with an en suite bathroom. The facilities in this building are lovely. But they could do so much better.   The rest -   Cleanliness - the room was dirty when we</value><value> arrived. Dust &amp; ants everywhere, clumps of hairs on the floor.   The money you save on booking here, you’ll spend on food, as they’ve turned off the cooking facilities (ovens and stoves). We booked her for two weeks, on our first day went and bought a load of shopping (trying to save money) only to realise the only thing you have to cook with, is a microwave! So for the large majority it’s either ready meals or take aways.   Apparently the ovens are turned off due to over sensitive fire alarms (more of these later!). We were told this has been a problem for two years now! So about those ‘over sensitive’ fire alarms. On our first night, after finding out basically nothing works here, the entire property was woken up at 1:30 by a fire alarm going off. Many had children and some of them extremely young (as it’s the summer holidays). There was a clear lack of leadership and I couldn’t even tell you where any of the staff from this facility were during the fire alarm.   A lot of things are misleading here - another being the WiFi. It’s only free in the newer building and even then, it doesn’t stretch to the common areas!   The cutlery and plates etc were a joke. A complete mismatch, when you take into account it’s full of families staying here, it’s difficult to find enough plates/cutlery to simply eat your meal. With this being paid accommodation, they could’ve at least bought some new kitchen stuff for the paying customers.   I’ve not been this disappointed by accommodation for a long time, if ever. Seems as if they’re honestly interested in making money with the university students are away.   In summary, please don’t waste your time or money. Yes it’s cheap but you’ll spend loads of food etc. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

So by mid week on 1st</value><value> and 2nd week the bathrooms were grubby. Not even toilet paper was replaced in the week so none available each time by Wednesdays. Rooms are not cleaned. Corridors not cleaned as same squashed cockroaches were on the hallway floor for the 2 weeks. One fridge for too many bedrooms. No kitchen paper towels to dry dishes. Left several times with loo roll to clean plates. Sorry bit if this service is provided as an alternative to hotels the least the owner of pop up can do is provide clean facilities. They are simply making a quick buck. The manager was rude when I asked to change rooms and told I could check out. NYE!!!! The only plus is your own room.

Breakfast was included in another building very basic.

The bathroom had a window into the bedroom that we had to cover so that people could shower without everyone getting to watch.  The worst part was the lack of communication.  Knowing there was no parking available but the website had mentioned a specific $28/day lot, I called as we drove there to get directions to the parking lot.  I was told to call a different number, which I did. They gave me very specific instructions to the lot and we found it successfully.  The next day, we were charged $55 to claim the car.  When I checked at the front desk, the manager told me they'd sent me to the wrong lot.  Upon inquiring if anything could be done about the $55 charge (times TWO vehicles), I was told it was my own fault for going to the wrong lot since the right lot was posted in the lobby.  It was the GLEBE PHONE LINE that gave me the incorrect information.  If the information was so readily available in the lobby, why didn't the call center have it?

The hostel is in a great location with Coles, Woolworths, Kings Cross station, and lots of eating and drinking options a short walk away. There is free WiFi, but the quality wasn't great. As with most Australian hostels I've stayed at, the rooms could do with plug sockets installed next to each bed. The lockers were of decent size.  The kitchen was awful. There was ONE usable hob, there rest were broken, and everything felt a bit grimy. I'd say it was borderline unusable. The only positive there is that there was plenty of fridge and storage space. But to make things worse they ask for a deposit to get a plate and cutlery - pretty rich when the kitchen is so poorly stocked and maintained to begin with.  Everything here needs improving, and given the number of hostels in the area, there are much better options nearby for a similar price.

I must say the requirement to empty the bin before leaving had me a trifle astonished too as it is not a quick and easy process involving as it does a walk down Oxford St (with your rubbish in hand) to the adjacent side street and then down it  and along the back lane to the bins.  That alone is enough to put me off ever staying here again.  The weather conditions in Sydney were mild during our stay so we were comfortable enough.  However, being on Oxford St, the place is noisy and the extractor fan from the pizza place downstairs runs up the rear wall so even the back bedroom is not spared from noise.  My advice - bring earplugs.  I did, and actually slept quite well wearing mine.  The stairs to get into the apartment are quite precipitous and will not suit anyone with impaired mobility.  The location is handy to St Vincent's Hospital and to the city.

My partner and I planned a short trip to Sydney and chose to stay here after viewing the pictures they had online, what a big mistake. We arrived early so understandably we</value><value> were not able to check in, but when we did we were shocked. I thought someone had stolen the furniture. The room contained a small two seater couch, big enough for one person, a dining table and 2 small single beds put together to make a double bed.   The cleaning of the room must have been rushed as it was dusty and not appealing at all.  The bed was so small that my feet hung over the end of it, the tv did not work at all during our stay, and the staff couldn’t fix it, leaving us to use our mobile phone as a tv! The dishwasher was full of dishes that had been washed but left sitting what could only be said for days and smelt like it too.  The rooms are connected to the Oaks hotel, however to check in you need to go into the next building to get your keys then back into the Oaks, where staff did not even know the room existed.   We had paid for breakfast with our stay and book in staff were unaware of this, however they eventually supplied us with vouchers for a cafe down the road, which was the only good thing about this venue.  We used the pool area and it looked old and outdated, with a hole in the roof, one broken deck chair, a spa that didn’t work the first time and as for the heated pool, well it was cold!!  If you are looking for somewhere to stay, don’t stay here as there are many other choices around here. As the photos show, the room lacks soul, with around 10m square of emptiness, no pictures on the walls and very tired.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

It is a stone's throw from Wyndam Train Station and there are places to eat downstairs, about 15 minutes walk to the Opera House. The entrance to this establishment is a full</value><value> size glass door sandwiched between 2 shops. On opening the door you are immediately confronted by a considerably tall staircase leading up to the second floor (which is the first floor of the hotel). There are no elevators, so beware, you will be dragging your bags up. And if you are elderly or in anyway physically disabled you will find it a challenge. The first floor contains the reception, some rooms and a communal kitchen and living area, both of which I would consider unnecessary in this location. Checking in and out was easy and the lady behind the counter was friendly and helpful. My room was quite small, just big enough for the double bed and side tables. There is a wardrobe which has a mini fridge and safe inside. The carpet was badly stained and dirty, paint was bubbling on the walls and it was very dusty. For me, the bed was way too soft and the water pressure in the shower was almost nonexistent if you want a hot shower! There was no aircon that I could see, only an old style electronic bar oil heater. Tea and coffee making facilities and an average flat screen TV on the wall with average reception. As I was only staying for one night I put up with it but I can't recommend a longer stay. I was told that it will be renovated soon, I certainly hope so as it would take a big improvement for me to return.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

And because there is nothing lower.  The location is the only thing to recommend it.  There is no elevator, so we had to carry our bags up four flights</value><value> of stairs (and back down when we left).  We had to be careful about showering because the steam would set off the fire alarm, causing a fine of over $1600.  The mattress was so hard it was no better than sleeping on the floor.  The advantage of the mattress was that it was clean.  The floor was not.  It had not been vacuumed since before the previous tenant.  (I found hair on my socks after walking across the floor.)  In other words, avoid this hotel at all costs.

The blackout of the room with 2 curtains is good. The TV is big enough and has an HDMI connection.  Minus : There is no breakfast. The windows do not close properly, so there is a hell of a noise at night because of the central location. The windows also cannot be opened properly. The outer windows have not been washed for years. The view is zero. The room does not have a chair or a desk. The room lighting is poor. The bed is only 90cm wide and not very comfortable. In the closet hang only 4 (four) hangers. There are not enough clothes racks in the closet. The safe does not work. There is no shelf for the suitcases. The air conditioning is always too cold. The provided soaps and shower gels are not very good. The washbasin is far too small, there are no shelves for toothbrushes and company. With every face wash I provoked a little flood. The hot and cold water control is not very reliable and must be constantly readjusted. The toilet paper is too thin. The shower is not cleaned thoroughly enough. The carpet could be cleaner.

I am a 25 year old so I can understand we are all in Australia but it was worse than being a 16/17 year old in Malia or Ayia Napa people falling all</value><value> over the place acting like children and having no respect for their neighbours.   As I arrived the man behind the counter seemed completely uninterested to help me saying that my key was in the box. What box? I've just arrived. He didnt tell me the code to the main entrance and didnt tell me where my room was I literally paid and was left to find my own way.   I entered the room and there was a 50 year old Aussie guy who claimed that he was a journalist so lived out of hotels. I was already sceptical as he was living out of carrier bags. All I am going to say is the guy was WEIRD. Making noises throughout the night, touching himself inappropriately, getting up and going for a walk at 2am in the morning. A lot of hostels in Australia have a policy of non locals and I understand why now. You get some absolute creeps staying otherwise.  In the morning I was woken up at 7.30am to people shouting. Some people laying in the street (presumably from the night before) and it just had no class.   I feel whilst writing this I am sounding like a fun sponge but realistically there is a huge difference between letting your guests pour onto the street falling all over the place and shouting until the early hours and being respectful to your customers and neighbours.   If you are looking to get smashed and hang around with a bunch of people who have been allowed to leave their parents for the first time this is the ideal place for you.   </value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

Considering the price, the prime location, the olden KingsX days still lingering in the air once you step outside - the Lido Suites is an absolute winner in my book.

Everything negative that others have written is true.  My daughter is currently sleeping on the floor because the sofa bed is so uncomfortable.  The mattress has springs (can't remember coming across</value><value> such a thing in the past 30 years!) and you can feel every one of them.  The pillows are so flat you might as well not have one and the sofa/lounge chairs have a very peculiar odour.  We are going out tomorrow to buy an inflatable bed so that she can at least get a semi-decent sleep.   Once the sofa bed is out you can't walk out of the bedroom without stepping over it and anyone wanting to use the bathroom has to come through the bedroom.  This is definitely a two-person unit and suitable only for people who do not like to look outside as there is no balcony or window looking beyond the fence outside.   It is so disappointing as we have just returned from our other family members who are staying in a 'manor' in Cremorne for the same $ value per night and it is beautiful with balconies and views.  </value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name>Fawlty Towers Hotel</hotel_name><hotel_star>3</hotel_star><title><value>Hell from down Under</value></title><date>201902</date><content><value>1st and foremost, the hotel is not call Fawlty Towers so if you are silly enough to stay here then make sure you mark it in as Peg Leg Inn. So from the name mix up already - after a long flight the last thing I needed was to find out the name on the accommodation is different</value><value> from the actuality.  Also - the basic amenities are all faulty. There is no lift so if you have heavy stuff then poor you - the idiot didn’t even offer to help.   There was no pleasant welcome just one flimsy piece of paper with the WiFi code and check out details. The only thing he communicated was that we as stayers are fortunate enough to receive 20% the food blah blah blah. But as the hotel gave me the creeps - I definitely did not eat here.  It’s a themed hotel - shipwreck vibe - if that means nothing to you that’s fine but it doesn’t sit well with me having to pass through ugly cheap basic skeleton decor in an accommodation that I booked for leisure . Our room had a flipping crack that was covered with cello tape ! - judging by how calm and unbothered these guys were I’m sure they think it’s part of the decor vibe so they are in no rush to fix it. The security of the building is also dodgy as people came in freely and never locked it.  The TV does not work and when mentioned (you have to walk all the way down stairs, out and back into the pub - the greasy manbun Guy was like ‘oooo that’s weird, come back and I’ll sort it’ ... cane back the next day and was rudely brushed off with ‘I don’t have my toolkit with me I’ll do it when I have it’ that was the second day of our 10 night stay and I’m still waiting after 5 days !  An open wire in the room near the tv and a random hole. The mugs given to us were dirty and the carpet smelled horrible - why would accommodation in Australia have carpet anyway? It’s tooo hot !  Two WiFi options never connected which was terribly frustrating . I would have to leave my room and go on the landing to get decent connection.  The shower also was blocked daily and not clean.  Do not stay here - go to ibis hotel or Sofitel .  The hospitality is worse than the dodgy craftiness of Jack Sparrow.  This place needs Gordon Ramsay to visit because I don’t understand how it’s running. It’s not a hotel, it’s not even a glorified hostel.

We stayed here 5 nights and it was awful. Keep in mind we are both in our 20’s and don’t mind basic accomodation. The pictures on booking.com do not accurately convey the student accomodation. Here is how the</value><value> following was;  Room: my partner and I got a double room, there was no air con but a large electric fan in the room. It was so noisy but we needed it on in the night because of the humidity! It was dusty and made you feel sick in the mornings. The sheets in our room were not changed over the 5 nights nor was our towels, we had to ask for new ones. I’ve been to hostels before and they usually change (and clean) the room every 3 days. In January heat, these things need changing!  Bathroom: *shudder*.  This was by far the worst thing about our stay. We were on the second floor so we had to use a unisex bathroom. It was really old, smelled of urine. The bathrooms were not cleaned consistently or well and were mostly in a disgusting state. I know people should tidy up after themselves but it’s not always the case so they need to be checked. The showers made me want to vomit with razors, boxers, hair and empty shampoo bottles left in the stalls. It was gross and left my skin crawling! There was a small, newer bathroom down the hall, slightly better but still dirty. They need to be renovated.  Kitchen; we bought some food to have our breakfast here to reduce the cost of our trip but ended up eating 5 out of 6 days. The oven was broken, the hob didn’t work, there was no toaster (basic!), no cups and limited cutlery. Very poor.   As we stayed in the old part of the building we were not told there was no elevator so keep in mind if you have 2 x 30kgs bags from travel!  On checking out, the guy at reception was too busy talking to someone else that they didn’t ask how our stay was or did we need a taxi booked or even have a good day. Basic customer service is lacking with some (not all) staff.

<item><hotel_name>The Grand Hotel</hotel_name><hotel_star>3</hotel_star><title><value>Good central budget accomodation</value></title><date>201904</date><content><value>Stayed for three nights, it is not easy to obtain inexpensive city centre accomodation in most cities, so I was happy to find this one. There is no reception, you check in at the bar, we received a friendly welcome and the key to our room.  The lift is a challenge, two heavy</value><value> doors which have to be opened manually, not easy when you have luggage. Our room was basic but clean and comfortable, obviously it would be better if ensuite, but I was aware when booking that the bathroom was in the corridor and shared. However, it did not present a problem. The hotel is on a busy street so there is some traffic noise. This was compounded by road works which took place 24 hours,and looks as if it will be ongoing for some time to come, so earplugs would be a good idea. . Breakfast is DIY. The room is on the third floor, there are cereals, fruit, bread, etc.you serve yourself and wash up your dishes.You can use it 24 hours a day, and there is a microwave, so if you wanted to bring in some food to heat it could be a cheaper alternative to eating out, which is generally quite expensive. We ate one night in the hotels restaurant, the food was good and reasonably priced. The location is good, just a short walk to the opera house, and to Darling Harbour. The staff were all very friendly, we had a few drinks in the bar which was often busy, prices were about average. If you have flown to Sydney, you can get a train and the nearest station is less than five minutes from the hotel. If you don;t mind basic accomodation, then this is an ideal choice, we would stay there again.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

The area has now, like many in the world, become somewhat gentrified with only a few strip clubs remaining with plenty of</value><value> trendy bars and coffee shops in their place. There is still a grittiness but nothing to the level of its reputation.  The hostel is clean and centrally located, the room we had had a private shower with shared toilet facilities just outside our room, there are a sufficient number of toilets so as not to have to be stuck waiting. The air conditioner in our room was piped out via the front window being open a crack so that did make it rather noisy at night, King’s Cross may have changed but it’s still a very lively area.   All in all, Central Perk is basic but relatively affordable. I wouldn’t recommend it per se, but you could stay in worse places in the area, and we did.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

The entrance is horrible &amp; dirty, with discarded cigarette ends strewn everywhere (it’s at the kitchen entrance of a restaurant &amp; right next to public toilets). The rooms are tiny &amp; the noise is really, really bad. The walls are super thin and I was woken up at least every hour by noisy guests, slamming doors &amp; talking (shouting) loudly. I’m not sure when the main photos were taken, but they look nothing like the hotel. It’s smelly, dirty &amp; noisy. The service was awful. There was no hair dryer in the room. No-one at reception until 9am &amp; when I called the out of hours mobile number, they just said I’d have to wait until 9. I was due to be at work at 8.30, but waited until 9 as I had wet hair... When someone did arrive at 9 and I explained, they said “I’m not working today, just leave your key on the table”, I asked them to repeat what they said &amp; they just snapped the same thing again. So I went to work with wet hair. No asking how my stay was, seriously no care in whether I did or not.

<item><hotel_name>Dixon Residences</hotel_name><hotel_star>3</hotel_star><title><value>Poor</value></title><date>201906</date><content><value>The entrance is filthy and is a bit obscure as this hotel is situated on the 3rd and 4th floors of a building and is directly above a karaoke bar that emitted loud music well into the morning for my entire stay. Bring earplugs! The elevator has an awful smell too and is never</value><value> clean. The bathroom is a big disappointment as it has two steps leading up the toilet and shower, which makes no sense at all and is a big hazard. There is also no exhaust fan so it always smells bad and requires a thorough cleaning as there is mould in the shower. There was no turndown service for my 3-night stay and therefore had to buy my own tea and milk as it didn't get replenished. Don't let the pictures fool you, the room is riddled with scuff marks/damage all over the room and it is very clear cleaning is kept to a minimum, as evidenced by the lamp covered in a thick layer of dust. I also didn't appreciate the 'queen' bed actually being two single beds joined together and therefore creating a very obvious and hard ridge in the middle of the bed. I stayed here because it was the cheapest hotel for my stay, but next time I'll go somewhere else regardless of the price.  It's right next to China Town if that is your kind of thing. Walking distance to Darling Harbor and shopping centers.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

Other people staying here were also very friendly and always said hello to us.  They were also respectful of the house rules and always cleaned up after themselves and kept noise to a minimum.  This place also has a nice outdoor area with a BBQ for guests to use and enjoy. It is also close to the bus stops (literally diagonally opposite) so you can take the very frequent buses to Manly Wharf or Warringah Mall in the opposite direction for Westfield shopping.  Driving around in your own vehicle is also not a problem in the area.  Or if you wanted to you could walk to the Wharf or Manly Beach from here.

<item><hotel_name>Manly Beach House</hotel_name><hotel_star>2</hotel_star><title><value>Expensive hostel type accommodation with a grubby feel</value></title><date>201803</date><content><value>I’ve stayed in many hostel type accommodations but none quite so grim as this. This is a lovely house, lovely features of a fitted kitchen, leather sofas in the lounge, tiled floors, tiled bathroom HOWEVER it would be hard to say when it was all last cleaned. Our room had mouldy</value><value> bedding, damp on the wall, dirt and coffee rings on the window sill, old soap remnants in the shower, dirty shower, grubby toilet, sticky tables.   The kitchen was disorganised, no washing up liquid, no tea towels, no cleaning cloths so people were not cleaning up after themselves. There was milk in the fridge with a use by date of 3 weeks prior to our arrival. The fridges were a health hazard with ‘stuff’ dripping and pooling to the bottom. There was food rotting and breaking down in bags. They had clearly not been cleaned out for weeks. The owner said we were welcome to make a cup of tea or coffee “if we could find a clean cup!!!”. There were none.   The laundry was piling up by the washing machine; don’t know whether it was guests washing or the hostels, but for $4 to use, it had to be emptied prior to being able to use!   A lovely outdoor area was untidy And when we went out for breakfast we found the table to be filthy with the remnants of the previous nights party with fag ends burnt into the seat cushions.  The WiFi signal was poor and we could not get access. We did not pursue this. The TV in the lounge was on morning noon and night. The area was not a communal area because of that.   The owner apologised for it being a mess and suggested that guests could not read the notices that said “Clean up after you or be charged a $20 Fee”. No body was cleaning up. Nobody. Within 5 minutes of being there we had filled the garbage bin (which wasn’t emptied) and used a shower spray and toilet paper to clean the work surface and to clean some mugs.   We paid about $125 for one night here and I have paid less in better places. It was not value for money. I booked it through Airbnb. This is not a room in someone’s home. It is not a Guest House.   I do not normally write reviews like this, but I was let down on this property. I don’t mind old furniture, a cobweb or faded paint, but what I do object to is a dirty room and kitchen. I usually take reviews with a pinch of salt as the pictures don’t normally depict the reality.   I submitted a review of the place on Airbnb but the owner did not mutually respond or allow for the review to be published. For somewhere so popular, it was half empty at Easter and there a only a handful of reviews.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

Our group was welcomed with open arms by the lovely friendly staff at the Gazebo Wine Bar. To be fair, however, we were a quiet group with none of the silliness</value><value> that can sometimes go hand in hand with hens nights.  The decor was modern with a chandelier overhanging the room. There are bench seats, small tables with stools and long tables for larger groups. The room is curved and this makes for the possibility of finding  a more private nook for a quiet conversation.   There is outside seating also, with gas heaters and blankets for cooler nights.  We did wait for almost two hours for our food, which was a little too long. Despite the wait we enjoyed ourselves and when it did arrive it was beautifully prepared and very tasty. We had a set menu for $55 each which was of a very high standard. It included shared entrees with vegetarian options as well as chicken liver pate, eggplant relish, ricotta and grilled bread to slather it all onto. Mains were also shared. We had chicken, a fabulous rigatoni with hazelnuts and a lovely smokey beef, beautifully tender and pink. All served with fresh salads and a delightful bean dish.  Dessert was definitely NOT for sharing - a small sliver of chocolate walnut brownie with ice cream and pistachios. Not too much and a great way to finish the meal.  A very reasonable price for a delicious 3 course meal in my opinion.  The drinks were well priced too -  I had a lychee and lime cocktail which was very enjoyable for $18 and with dinner, a glass of dry white wine for $11.    There is piped music which I found just a tad too loud for easy conversation,  but I am a woman of a certain age - the young folk in our group didn't have a problem! There is a parking station literally 20 steps from the venue so if you are driving you won't have any trouble finding a place for the car. Taxi's abound in the streets nearby also.  I did not visit the amenities but was told that they were clean and well maintained.  A lovely night was had by all.   </value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

Misty morning made our breakfast time magical. Basked in white gentle sunlight, caressed by the pleasant warmth of the fireplace that fought the heavenly cold mountain air trying to get inside when we opened the door. The garden view though the large French windows, the hot bacon on our plates we ate. The stay did not give a commercial feel like those common in hotels or motels. It was quite and secluded. It felt like home away from home. There’s a living room, a separate bed room, and the bathroom with a spa. Warm dip massaged by water jets in cool autumn, it was awesome. BBQ facilities was available, but too bad it rained and so we had no chance to enjoy an outdoor BBQ dinner. There was a washing machine and a dryer. The cottage was truly self-contained.

Hopefully there are rooms with better views that what I had.   The windows were frosted since there was no view of anything except a light well.   The rumble of the ventilation system was</value><value> distracting.   Another detracting factor was the noise of the cables on the top of the lift [elevator].  My final annoyance was the noisy staff whose voices echoed in the light well at 6am.   Surely they could have had their conversation elsewhere in quieter tones?   After all their job depends on the people they wake so early. The hotel promoted their Greek restaurant next door.   At about 8pm I wanted to go for a meal.  The place was busy; but the door was locked!  Not a very reliable place to eat.  Good there are lots of restaurants in the area.  The discounted breakfast was good value for money.    Although the hotel is dated,  the rooms were clean and had all the necessities.   Front office staff were helpful and friendly. The hotel was in two sections with different lifts.

Plenty of restaurants, pubs, shopping and activities in the area. Staff was young and very indifferent, they did their job but were not engaging in any way.  The pod itself was unique and adequate, although the AC/fan</value><value> was terrible so the unit does get rather hot at night.  Also, the USB charging port inside of the pod barely worked so could not get a full charge on a phone even after 6-7 hours.  The pods do block out any noise, so can be noisy, depending on the courtesy of your neighbors.  The mattress was just a 2" pad, nothing plush but not uncomfortable either.  The pod offered a small safe for extra security of cash, passport, and other small items.  A luggage locker was also provided, measuring about 14"x14"x34".  The locker was sufficient to store a basic backpack or other medium-sized soft luggage.  As others have noted, the bathrooms are small!!  The hostel is located on the upper floors of the building.  While there is an elevator, it seemed slow and potentially unreliable.  On the plus side, the WiFi was strong and reliable and there was plenty of hot water.

<item><hotel_name>Space Q Capsule Hotel</hotel_name><hotel_star>2</hotel_star><title><value>Good hostel alternative for introverts</value></title><date>201902</date><content><value>This is a great novelty hotel. Well, more a hostel than a hotel, actually. The name is misleading. The entrance is cool in that it's just a long corridor leading to a heritage elevator, with a bit of mystery feel. The capsule itself is surprisingly convenient and comfortable</value><value> (comparing to a hotel stay), and all of your important stuff is actually nearby in the pod with you. I did not feel claustrophobic at all, even with the capsule sealed.   The kitchen area is spacious and clean, and laid out in a convenient way that even someone who isn't a backpacking teenager who doesn't normally cook, would actually want to use it. The chill out space is a separated space adjoining it, making the kitchen area more quiet and comfortable. That said, the location is extremely convenient, so even if you were to eat out, you easily could.  Where this hotel fell short for me, is everything else. For starters, although I booked a room in the girls' dorm, they somehow 'ran out' and put me in the men's dorm. This is not that terrible considering the pods are enclosed. That said, it's not my preference, and more importantly, the bathrooms are then on the wrong floor. Every time I had to go to the bathroom or shower, I have to climb up the stairs.   To make this worse, the showers are extremely small, except for the end ones. How small? There's just enough space for you to stand in it, and turn around - and that's about it. To emphasise, I am a tiny, slender, 5 foot Asian, and even I would wait for the end showers to become free. There are no ledges or hooks to put your bath things on while you shower, which means you probably have to dump them in the tiny corner sink. It's possible to drape your towel over the door and have it stay dry, but your change of clothes would have to be hung outside. The place clearly sliced up a too-small space into too many showers, to comply with some kind of planning regulations 'on paper'.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

No reception until 2pm to 5pm (in theory) then closed for one hour to 6pm, and then only on call.....If outside use your own phone, if inside phone ondesk top.Elderly potential customers should be told aboutt the steep tiled stairs and no lift.I did ask to change my room, so I had basic T.V. and I did not listen to the dripping tap.  "No" even though they had vacancy signs downstairs .  I stayed there for 10 days.!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

They even extended our stay (enabling us to</value><value> stay in the same room) before we asked for them to do so, preempting us having difficulty house hunting! What service!!!! We were asked to give honest feedback on the rooms, which we did and for our 'improvement points' these were all taken on board actioned. For everyone who has written bad reviews, I would read them with caution.  Manly Beachside Apartments - as it advertises itself - is budget accommodation.  Budget accommodation means that some of the thrills and frills of e.g. the Ritz are omitted!!  I would definitely book here again as well as recommending it to my own family and friends.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

It's quiet, clean, extremely handy to everything you'll want to do. The perfect location for the convention centre, casino, ferries, city. Being just two blocks from Darling Harbour, you have a safe and easy walk to anywhere, to any ferry, at any time of day or night. Our only gripe was our unit's view was into the back of an office block. My fault: should have asked for the views featured in site photos. The apartment really has everything you need and the managers respond SO quickly if there's any issue (at check in, the manager noticed a minor plumbing issue and the plumber was on site shortly after). If these apartments don't meet your needs, you must be pretty hard to impress. Absolutely perfect.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name>Astra Apartments Sydney - Kent Street</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Comfy, spacious, convenient</value></title><date>201803</date><content><value>The apartments are in a secure building that has many residential apartments, and some units available for travelers.  It is close to Darling Harbor, just across the Pyrmount Bridge, so it is just a short walk to Harborside shops, restaurants, attractions like Sea Life and the</value><value> maritime museum, and train stations.  A full range of restaurants, from a fast food court to upscale dining,  are available at Harborside.  Also, there are convenient cafes on Kent Street close to the unit.  We really liked Cafee Amici, which is right next door, and Cozy Cafe, which is half a block away.    When we were there, George Street was under construction for a new train line into the city.  As a result, the monorail was not running and many buses were rerouted.  We walked most places and used the train for attractions that were too far to walk.  Once the construction work is done, the unit will be even more convenient to get around using the train system.    Our unit was clean, spacious and comfortable.  The bed was great, with lots of pillows.  Internet access worked well.  The balcony is cute, but we did not use it much because we were on the 10th floor, and it was a long way down.  We had a great view of the harbor.  The kitchen was well stocked with pots, pans, dishes, utensils, etc.  We appreciated the laundry, as we had been on the road for a month.  We would be happy to stay there again.    The units are rented more by business travelers than tourists.  There is no concierge or tourist information on site.  If you are prepared to be self sufficient, that's fine.  But if you depend on someone on site to recommend restaurants, to orient you on the city map or tell you where to get a cab or the train, you will be frustrated.  The unit would be more attractive for non-business travelers, if there was at least a Sydney map on site.     Also, the unit was surprisingly limited in consumable supplies.  We were staying for an entire week.  The unit had one packet of dishwasher soap and one packet of laundry soap.  We ended up leaving unwashed (but rinsed) dishes, because we did not have any  more dishwasher soap and did not want to buy an entire box for one load.  Also, there was no salt and pepper, and no spare toilet paper.    When you arrive, you must telephone to the office (which is not on site) and a manager comes over to meet you and give you a key.  We received very limited information from the manager.  She did not tell us, for example, that the key ring has a fob that needs to be shown to a sensor in order to get the elevator to operate.  (Maybe most people would know that?  It took us a while to figure it out.)  The building has a gym and swimming pool, which our room key opened, but we did not know they were  there until our last day.  It took us two days to figure out how to run the air conditioner.  A manual was on site, but we did not find it for two days. Overall, these were very minor issues, but it would be really helpful if there was a binder of information about the unit on site.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

Tesco Metro is literally around the corner so great to be able to pick up water, few last minutes items. Staff on reception and behind the bar we a pleasure to deal with, so</value><value> nice and friendly. There is a lift in the hotel lobby but quite small. Our room faced onto the street ans could be loud with traffic and at night time but we were both supplied with ear plugs ( you needed to keep the window open for some air.) Room was quite small for £140 a night, and you would not want to be a larger person or you would not fit in the shower. Our beds were comfortable and we got 2 decent sized pillows. Full length mirror on the wardrobe was greatly appreciated. I have seen other people complain about the breakfast, all cooked, or toasted sandwiches. I would prefer the option of having poached or scrambled egg instead of fried, and I agree with other people who stayed here that some fruit in the morning would have been nice.   The guy who did Karaoke every night ended up singing the same songs over and over, and we all found the PA system to be turned up so loud we couldn't hear each other without yelling. All the bar staff, cleaners, front of house staff were absolutely brilliant. The decor and facade of the hotel is amazing. It's a pity the hotel name has changed so many times - we found that taxi drivers were confused about what hotel we were talking about. This hotel only serves breakfast and no other meals. Very close (2 min walk) to shopping area, loads of bars, restaurants close by - also close to the train station. About a 25 mins taxi journey from the airport.

The rooms are more than adequate for</value><value> a single traveller.  Clean and functional.  However, unless you are happy staying out late and not wanting to sleep before the early hours (if you are on that kind of trip then it would be perfect for you) then think twice (ear plugs were supplied in some of our rooms - and are essential).  The noise that travels up from the venue below can be heard extremely clearly in the rooms and is very disruptive.  The only option for breakfast is a cooked breakfast - no fruit, yoghurt or pastries on offer.  The breakfast itself is excellent - but more (healthier) choices would have been nice.  If you are in a partying group and want a late night venue with a cooked breakfast then go for it......if you want a quieter stay and some healthier options look elsewhere.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name>Balmain Wharf Apartments</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Truly, a harbour-side wonder</value></title><date>201412</date><content><value>Balmain Wharf Apartments are in a wondrous position facing Sydney Harbour.  It’s a great spot for a vacation or for a base for a work trip.  This is a beautifully-restored former waterside pub, converted into holiday apartments.  We (my wife and my humble self) stayed in</value><value> apartment # 4, “The Parapet”.  I went ahead to set up camp whilst my wife was at a work appointment in downtown Sydney;  I was greeted by the very friendly Gerri who assisted with bags and was quite happy to explain everything about the apartment.  Certainly worth the effort to see the wondrous expression on my wife’s face when she got “home”.  The location of the apartments cannot be beaten.  You are quite literally steps away from the bus stop outside, or the Balmain East ferry wharf across the street.  If you come armed with an Opal Card, you will have mastered local public transport.    Unfortunately the Balmain East ferry wharf is currently closed for renovations (due to re-open in mid 2015); a pity, because nothing beats commuting on water – relaxing, usually prompt, and by-passing all those nasty land-based traffic jams.  Several other reviewers have commented on the bus turning point just outside.  I found that we simply just found ourselves getting used  to this, and noise then just faded away.   Car-parking is a challenge;  although Gerri can lend you a resident’s parking permit, it can still be hard to find a vacant street spot.  If you can travel without a motor vehicle, so much the better (and far more liberating for you, what with the range of public transport available).  Presumably, if you had the budget, you could use the water taxi system too.  Our apartment was very well kitted out, including a welcome basket of basic groceries.  You can supplement these with trips to the local East Balmain shops (up the hill), or to the main Balmain shops.  Both areas are an easy bus ride away (or walk up a steep hill to get to the East Balmain shops).  Being Christmas, the apartment even featured some seasonal decorations!  These homely touches went well in this beautifully decorated, clean and comfy apartment.  Add to this the large porch (including barbeque), where you can relax and watch the harbour traffic sail by (including some rather startlingly-sized ocean liners).  The kitchen is rather compact, but all worked out well for 2 people with a little bit of practice.    Taxis were a little bit hard to come by (being pre-Christmas), but Gerri had access to several drivers’ mobile phone numbers – thus enabling us to by-pass the radio rooms that continue to contribute to the mess that is  Sydney’s poor taxi system.  And that was about it, folks!  Lovely afternoons relaxing on the porch watching the boats sail by.  Walking around the neighbourhood to admire the very eclectic range and styles of housing is also worthwhile.  All in all, to really enjoy this lovely location you should leave the car at home if at all possible, and follow your nose to this harbour-side wonder.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

We notified them that we would check in at 2 pm (as per normal check-in time) and when we got there the lady at reception talked on the phone for 5 minutes while we were just standing</value><value> around, even though there were two other men standing around doing nothing.   When we got our key and went to our room, two maintenance guys were standing on top of our bed in the bedroom (yes on top of the sheets) busy changing lights in the ceiling fan. They just said “Oh sorry we will be quick” so I figured we would wait. We sat there for almost ten minutes, then I told reception via message that someone was there and no one responded.   Eventually I went down and told them at reception and they just said Oh sorry!  I then stood around for another 10 minutes waiting to get another room. Fair enough they gave a room but I missed a meeting because of this and my fiancé had been working since early morning and wanted to sleep so we just had to wait around wasting time. When I went back to the initial room to pick up my bag the guys were STILL working in the room. How bad is that, and the fact that they think its okay for us to sleep in the room if other people were standing on the bed with their shoes.   They also market this as SERVICED apartments. Not once during our 3 night stay was any service done. No cleaning, no replenishing shampoos etc, nothing  The last night we got in our key also did not work anymore.   I strongly advise anyone to look for other options. This is over-promise, under deliver so sorry that I did not go with something else.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

Firstly, our apartment was on situated across the road from the official address. We were in Apartment 3. The location of the apartment is great. A few eateries just outside from the apartment. A short drive to suburban malls.   The</value><value> place is nothing like the photos on the website. The apartment is small, not great in layout and the place is not very clean.   The air con/heater was not working at all throughout our stay. This is the middle of winter. The night manager did bring us a portable heater and mentioned that the equipment was recently serviced. But the aircon heater was coated with a thick layer of dirt. I had to clean it with a wet wipe. Was this really serviced?  The kitchen is tiny and very basically equipped. We could not really cook in the apartment. There is no ventilation and would stink up the entire room.   The bathroom is horrid and old. The vanity had missing door knobs. The walls are in need of a fresh coat of paint. The shower stall is small and the sliding door doesn’t close, so water flows out as you shower. The tiny bathroom houses the washing machine ( which didn’t work), and also a sink to wash and rinse the mops. Very odd layout and placing of items.   Don’t use the washing machine. It’s either very old or not really working. The one evening we washed a load of laundry, during the spin cycle, the machine shook so violently and loudly, we thought it was going to explode. The machine actually shook and moved out of its original position by one machine width.   We will never come back.   </value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

The shared facilities are spotlessly clean as well (its shared bathroom which is definitely reflected in the price). The kitchen is huge with all the appliances you need to fully cater for yourself - this must be a great option for people wanting to stay for a week or two. I’d say you’d be hard pressed to find self catering accommodation of this standard for this price in such a location. The team downstairs in the bar are great - really welcoming.

We stayed for 3 nights and, by the end of our stay, we were sold on the Siesta. The location is</value><value> fantastic... a short walk to the ferries or train. Lots of restaurants close by... but we took the ferries almost everywhere. For the price and convenience you'd be hard pressed to find a better option. Basic kitchen facilities are available and we cooked several meals after stopping at the Coles grocery that is close by. This is located in the busy business district so expect city noise. Free laundry was a nice bonus.  If I had a complaint it would be the bathrooms and showers. Though plenty hot and clean, they would rank right up there with the least convenient I have every used. There is nowhere to but your cloths/toiletries when you're in the shower and really nowhere to put stuff outside the shower either. Its a crap layout. The showers are horrible. They need to add lots of hooks and some shelves to keep your things up and dry while you shower.   The convenience and cost make the Siesta a 4 out of 5. I'd definitely recommend it.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

Most of the staff where nice although one (who I believe could be the Manger) was rude to my girlfriend when she asked to use the internet Cafe computers. Although they where clearly free he flat out rejected her. He also loves the sound of his own voice and is the tannoy daily disturbing you  Rule wise. Check out is 9am! What even is that haha? If  you want to cook you have to go to reception to ask to use the pots and pans... They also clean the bathrooms at like 8am so if you are wanting a shower before checkout or before work it is a large in convenience.  Decent room but that is about that.

Beds weren't bad for hostel bunkbeds. Employees were all very friendly. Location was good, with easy access to train station. However, a few things were unexpected and quite annoying compared to other hostels: 1) 9am checkout. Who</value><value> does that? 10 seems to be the industry standard, so 9am just feels like you're getting shorted. 2) Kitchen closes at 9am for cleaning. This is just a pain. Most people are still using it at this time. You also aren't allowed to cook after 9.30pm, so no late night meals, if you're into that. 3) You have to go to the front desk to borrow cookware and have to pay a dollar deposit to use a coffee mug. Just ridiculous. I've stayed at hostels all over the world and never encountered this before. 4) There are lockers to store luggage in for the day after checkout, but you have to pay for them and they are fairly small. I was able to fit a 45L pack and a mid size duffel. If you have a large suitcase, it's unlikely to fit. I would have rated this hostel 4 or 5 stars, but for the above inconveniences it only gets 3. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

We loved it so much that we are already planning our next vacation at the start of summer again this year!  Thank you Manly Surfside!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name>Manly Surfside Apartments</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Avoid this company</value></title><date>201901</date><content><value>The apartment was in a nice location but otherwise lacked recent tending to. The surfaces were worn down, bathrooms were of old standard and there were a lot of signs of water damage from the shower and windows that had not been properly fixed, only repainted. Extensive mould. </value><value> The worst experiences from this stay were dealing with their staff. I have travelled in most parts of the world but have never encountered a place of business more lacking in communication skills, reliability, honesty, professional conduct and decency as Manly Surfside. These ladies do not appear to have the competence or the person skills to be a part of a tourist business.  My best advice is to choose any other company for your stay in Manly. But if you choose M.S, be sure to get everything important in writing up front. Double-check and ask to confirm everything important, like appointments. I wish I had recorded the conversations I had with their staff, they would go viral because of the impertinence and lack of professional conduct. They don´t seem to have any limitations to how far they will go in rudeness, including harassment and plain threats (!). My encounter with Manly Surfside rates to a single star, but I give them two because Manly is the nicest place ever. As long as you avoid having anything to do with these people you will have a fantastic stay in Manly.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

I asked for clean bed linen and was told by the receptionist that housekeeping wouldn't</value><value> be available until the morning. I then asked to be moved to a different room. The receptionist reluctantly agreed. The room I was moved to was even worse. A pungent sewage smell was coming out of the bathroom. This time, the receptionist claimed that she "couldn't smell anything" ... but then offered to bring me air freshener. I insisted to be moved to a room with clean bed linen that didn't smell like faeces. Apparently, "all the rooms were booked". I did a quick search on the Ryals Hotel website and proved the receptionist was lying. When I asked to speak with the manager, the receptionist begrudgingly offered to change the dirty bed linen in the first room herself. The following morning, I raised my complaint about this horrible experience with the manager. Her response was, "oh yes, I've discussed it with my staff, I hope we'll do better next time and you'll give us another chance". Absolutely not!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

Staff were nice, but I had problems with them finding my reservation initially, even though it was all booked and paid for in advance with an agent.

<item><hotel_name>Liv Apartments</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Absolutely appauling service!!</value></title><date>201906</date><content><value>I am absolutely disgusted with how I have been treated my Liv Apartments Staff particularly the Women named Kelly from the Darling Harbour Complex.   I booked their Penthouse for an event in August via bookings.com full stop new line when I was completing my booking it gave me</value><value> the option to pay later which I selected assuming I would need to pay a deposit. when I got an email stating that they had tried to charge my credit card I rang them to find out the policy around payment to ensure our accommodation with secure. Kelly was the one I spoke to who was quite abrupt and rude and said that they only accept full payment. I explained that a Pay Later option was available and asked if a deposit could be left and I will try and sort something out and she reluctantly said she would speak to her manager and get back to me she made it clear that she would give me till Friday to pay the full amount or she wouldn't cancel my reservation. I haven't got a call back so I called this morning as she said I had till Friday. when I called the number I went through too some kind of Hotline that told me I had to email the apartment and they gave me the email address. Apparently they prefer to communicate via Email than over the phone. so because of this and the fact that every time I rang I spoke to a new person I sent a brief email explaining the situation and that I thought I could pay later and ask for someone to contact me. Kelly then rang me and rudely accused me of complaining that I couldn't pay later and demanded that I paid the full fee. I explained to her that I didn't have it at the time and I was in the middle of organising it and that if she could give me till after lunch I should be able to pay the full amount after that call ended about 10 minutes or so later I got an email saying my accommodation had been cancelled. because she called me a for mobile number I returned her call and inquired as to why my accommodation was cancelled Kelly then denied cancelling my accommodation and suggested that the manager had done it. however throughout the day when I've asked to speak to a manager there has never been one available. so I decided to send an email because by this time I was frustrated and annoyed we've had been treated and spoken to. I think got a call back from Kelly saying that it was cancelled automatically because I didn't pay by Friday being today which surprises me because originally Kelly had told me that if I didn't make full payment by today she would cancel it so that alone is conflicting enough. like I said I would I arranged the full amount to pay for the accommodation and our early check in and late check out and after speaking to booking.com and them trying to contact Kelly I also tried to call her. I found it odd that my call was being ignored and decided I try of a private number where my call was then answered the moment she heard my voice she hung up on me. I tried numerous amount of times to call and again was hung up on constantly. I also emailed and was basically called a liar in regards to how I was treated and what was said to me. We were willing to pay $ 815 for our stay for one night however now I do not feel comfortable going near the complex or ever booking in the future. I've never experienced such a poor customer service in my life and highly do not recommend this apartment. I can't believe how hard it was just to try and book a room and the fact that I was offered an additional service that apparently is not offered through the apartment there was no compassion for the misunderstanding. I would also like to point out that not all accommodation offers a Pay Later option so this is obviously something that they can choose to have on their profile when you're making a booking and they can also choose to have it removed. What frustrates me even more is in their cancellation email their payment policy is that you must leave a 50% deposit and have the last 50% paid within thirty days of your stay I was booking for the 3rd of August to the 4th of August so realistically according to their policy I should have been allowed to leave a 50% deposit and should have been allowed to pay the rest off by the 3rd of July. Very disgusting and disgraceful behaviour coming from one an adult to a hospitality professional and three someone that works in customer service if I could give negative stars I would.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

We booked  for 2 adults and one child (5 years old) and when we arrived at our room in the early evening we noticed there was not a roll away bed of any type for our 5 year old son</value><value> to use. I immediately looked at my booking, making sure it was for 3 people and then contacted reception to try and sort the issue out straight away.  I was told by the gentleman on the other end of the phone that we did not have a bed for our son as part of our reservation and that none was available for us to use. This meant that he had to sleep in the same bed as us which was extremely unsatisfactory, given that we had paid for him as part of our reservation. I was made to feel this was my problem and no solution was offered by the person on the phone for that night. Thinking that we may find a roll away bed or something similar for our second night once we returned to our room after a day exploring Sydney, we were once again disappointed to see that there was nothing for him to sleep on so he had to sleep in our bed again. There was no one at reception upon our return that night so we had no one to contact. A similar scenario occurred on our third and final night and this left a hugely negative experience on our family holiday. We paid for 3 people to stay at the hotel and yet at no point were 3 people catered for in our room. Our son had to sleep in the same bed as us, which meant we had terrible nights sleep and also there was never even a 3rd towel for him to use in the shower. Wouldn't recommend or use this hotel again!!!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

The ensuite was on the other side of the entrance. The ensuite was huge with a great shower with plenty of pressure. The bed was comfortable but low to the ground. There was a "very" small TV in the sitting area and a single chair in front of it with bench type seating down one wall. All of the seating was very low. The room was clean and pretty quiet. If you are elderly be aware that the seating and bed are very low to the ground. Definitely not your average hotel but quite quirky. Would stay again and recommend as long as you are fairly flexible and can get up from low seats.

We asked what time checkout was, and one staff member offered us a later checkout (11:00am) free of charge, which was greatly appreciated.  The room itself was a little small, but comfortable. We had a small balcony. Beds were comfortable.  The only thing I can really fault is that there was a bit of wear and tear, particularly in the bathroom. I understand these things can't always be fixed right away, but they do give the appearance of the room being less clean. Other than that, the room was generally very clean.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

Bed is bouncy and uncomfortable. Not a good sleep. No exhaust fan in toilet/shower made for a steamy and stinky stay. Carpet under furniture very dusty and dirty. No power points in bathroom.  As Glebe is so easy to get to via bus or Uber if you stay in city or Pyrmont it’s not a big deal. We did not see the LED light display as per  the photos. Too cold to go up on a roof top.

<item><hotel_name>Ibis Sydney World Square</hotel_name><hotel_star>3</hotel_star><title><value>Central but Old</value></title><date>201907</date><content><value>Whilst the Ibis World Square was quite central and within walking distance of everything, these are the best positives I could find. The 'dining room/buffet' was very second rate and not what I'm used to with Accor Hotels. There was a picture on the lift doors of a deal for</value><value> buffalo wings + 2 beers for $22 which looked amazing, so we decided to try it. BIG mistake. They were certainly not buffalo wings and they were partially cold. Best thing about this meal was the beer. I did let them know on checking out and the staff were apologetic and gave us the meals for half price, but even then, I don't believe that was enough. The ambience (if you could call it that) was woeful. There was music, but it was terrible, so we ended up putting on the music from our phone. We had one breakfast there, which was buffet style...also not great. Was only game to eat toast.  The rooms were small, but they did the job. It was a game of hide 'n' seek to find the tea and coffee making facilities in the room. For anyone wondering, it is in a tiny cupboard underneath where you sit your suitcases. You had to get on all fours to reach it. Bathroom is TINY. There was 3 of us trying to use at once. There was a little pull out mirror on the wall along with the larger mirror, but you still couldn't have 2 in the bathroom at a time. A mirror out in the actual room would have been a big plus. The beds were very comfortable, but room not soundproof. With a pub on each corner it was quite noisy when trying to get to sleep. I'd suggest earplugs. When we arrived back to our room on the first night, someone from the room next door had put their dirty dinner plate near our door and it wasn't collected by housekeeping until a day and a half later (on checkout it had been removed). When our room was made up, all they did was make the beds (and not very well). There were 2 empty beer bottles which we left on the table which were not taken away with housekeeping. Overall, I wouldn't stay here again as I believe there would be better rooms in the CBD for similar price range.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name>Ibis Sydney World Square</hotel_name><hotel_star>3</hotel_star><title><value>Surprised!</value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>Thought we’d give an Ibis a try for a quick over-nighter.    Not the most salubrious location in Australia, but it’s still very safe and if you like East Asian cuisine, located right on the edge of Sydney’s China Town.   Fairly easy walk to Central Station or Museum underground</value><value> station, reasonable walk to the Darling Harbour tourist trap, or a good healthy walk (or quick underground ride) to Circular Quay and the cheap ferries of Sydney Harbour.   Hotel was clean and cheerful, as were the staff. The minimalist  room was only on level four, so no view, but the street noise was still very low at night.    Dinner was pretty straightforward and nothing to write home about, but enough to justify a long walk to Darling Harbour to work it off.    But the big surprise was the $1 buffet breakfast (or $15, depending on your room rate). Not quite Pullman Bunker Bay, but we were really surprised at how good it was. The jovial Korean Chef made us feel most welcome at breakfast and kept us entertained;  we actually enjoyed being outside in the morning watching the busy intersection two floors below, and our Chef kept checking on our welfare in the cool weather, and brought eggs to order.    In all, terrific value - and really surprisingly good for a budget hotel. We’ll be back.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

Well this is the place for you! With a ridiculously small access being awkward enough to get a suitcase and backpack into on its own then the fun of getting inside is even futher increased by the only way up is via a crazy steep</value><value> stairwell as there are NO elevators at all either! Photos will be attached with review! One person of a couple that arrived as we did had to find alternative accomodation as she has a wheelchair. Well the staff didn't want to hear from the upset partner that they should advertise this place as non stairgoer friendly so as we were a group of 3 couples and only needed 1 nights stay we would give it a go anyway as we had already booked and paid!  So Up the stairs we climb hoping noone needs to come back down and into our room which was right next door to the the communal kitchen facilities which by the way is Awesome if you like to be woken by people making a coffee or snacks all night with the beeping of the microwave and clunking of cups and dishes in the sink!  Oh and its like having your own talkback radio stuck on with the hotel communal sitting area just outside room with your non soundproof doors.  Out of the 3 rooms we as a group hired not one bathroom had a door that wasnt broken and just to top it off My mate found a cockroach near his bed so decided to take it to reception to emphasise his unhappiness with our accomodation! Funny story but they didn't want the roach at their desk either!!  After an awful nights sleep i needed a wake up shower to find that our water heater was freezing and not to mention gross mould build up around the sink photos will be attached!.  Also a couple of days after we left they charged non existant mini bar charges to our friends room. They were refunded after enquiry and complaints but made us concerned about what they did with our credit card details they photo copied front and back! Also a warning with the bathroom doors there are warning signs that steam from bathroom sets off fire alarms and that there will ne a $1700 fine charged to customer if they are set off! Lucky we had no hot water!  For cheap and just needing a bed for the night its ok but next time would spend a few more dollars for something better.   It is a good location for walking to opera house and cruise departure and central for shopping and bars.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name>The Village Kings Cross</hotel_name><hotel_star>2</hotel_star><title><value>Mr</value></title><date>201811</date><content><value>An absolute disgrace. After a 13 hour bus journey we arrive here with all our bags to be presented by squashed cockroaches at the entrance &amp; ‘Sofia’ an incredibly rude receptionist, who, as we try &amp; squeeze through the door to reception, makes zero effort to welcome us &amp; even</value><value> though she’s located clearly infront of us consciously ignores us. We ask if it’s possibly to check in, in which she replies “not until 2”. I understand that this is standard procedure to a certain extent in most hostels so this is not a problem. She didn’t offer to help with any of our luggage even though we arrived 5 &amp; a half hours before their allocated check in time, then looked at us in discust when asked if we could store our things somewhere. We walked around city to try &amp; kill the time. We then arrive back at 1:15 wet &amp; cold from the weather, but she refuses to let anyone check into their rooms until exactly 2oclock. After all of this they then make a mistake with our booking &amp; we get allocated beds in two seperate rooms even though we clearly booked as a pair. ‘Sofia’ being the miserable, disgruntled woman that she is, showed zero sympathy towards our situation &amp; did absolutely nothing to resolve the issue or make it any easier. In each of our seperate rooms there are spare beds still, but she refuses to let us pair up. They also refuse to give us any kind of refund. The bedrooms are dirty &amp; dingy &amp; the hostel has zero atmosphere. I feel like I’ve been sent to military jail to serve a sentence. Every wall is labelled with warning signs of everything you are not allowed to do, all highlighted with the fines which will be imposed if broken.    I’m so disappointed that this will forever be my first impression of Sydney... I’m not one to leave reviews, but after travelling all over the world for the past year this is by far the worst I have ever been treated &amp; would advice anyone considering it to stay here to stay well away. It’s an embaressment to the company name &amp; hostels in general &amp; having spent $200 to stay here for the next 3nights I can’t help but feel like I’ve been taken full advantage of.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

Coles supermarket was five minutes walk away, but there were plenty of other supermarkets on route to the city. There are plenty of restaurants and take-aways so you will never go hungry!

The bathrooms looked clean (considering they are shared) but we were happy we had some flipflops that could be worn in the shower.  The bed and bath linens felt, looked, and smelled clean.  Everything in the rooms worked, although we did not turn on the television to test that.  The wifi was acceptable too.  Breakfast the following morning was nothing special, but it was adequate with assorted breads, jams, cereals, fruits, and that sort of thing.    The primary benefit to this place is the location.

First impressions from the outside is that it is lacking maintenance, you will see many examples of painting over flaking paint.The reception is</value><value> non existent. You knock on a door and when is opened you enter some sort  some sort of staff rest room with a desk against the wall. My wife wanted to leave! The staff are very friendly, no complaints at all. We were allocated a room in a building opposite on the third floor. Carrying two cases at 30kgs up three flights of stairs is no joke so if you are booking, request a ground floor room. The room was very clean, the sheets/towels etc pristine and it was the best bed we had slept in during our stay, sort of a Queen Bed I would guess. We did not have a car but parking is very limited and you would have to be good to get in and out without a '49 point turn'! Last tip. The key they give you does not lock the door, it only opens it. You have to push the button in on the inside door handle and then just close it. If it had a reception, and some more care it could easily move to 4/5 stars. Finally, if you were using at as a  base it looked to have everything you could need for a longer stay, like a self contained room really.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

The kitchen stovetop range does not work very well (only a couple burners work) and the kitchen closes early at 9:30 pm. And while the private bathrooms were nice to have, I found mine a bit disappointing: when you shower, the whole bathroom gets wet, and in high humidity it does not dry.

Allow me to suggest that you are clearer on your website about the need to book ahead for parking. There is one small mention of 'limited parking for a fee'. Everywhere else I have ever stayed, limited has meant no</value><value> more than one car per booking. I booked a hotel as I was going to a site at the Enmore Theatre that night and, having mobility issues, did not want to have to struggle with public transport. That morning I received a text saying that all parking was booked out that night but that you were just a hop, skip and jump from Newtown station. That may be all very well for people who can hop, skip and jump, but I cannot. I had to manage my bags and a walking stick and a staircase at Redfern station changing for Newtown. The pain that I was in by the time I arrived severely hampered my enjoyment of the show that evening and my sleep that night.  A clear "please be aware that parking must be booked and is not guaranteed" on the website and confirmation email would have made a world of difference for me. I could have chosen not to book and left my space for more able bodied customers.  Other than that, I was very pleased with the hotel. The concierges who checked me in and out were lovely and professional, and I enjoyed the inner-city industrial chic vibe.

Direct services also run to Manly. The staff are pleasant, professional and well trained. Included breakfast was more than satisfactory for me and two growing boys; choices of pastries, cereal, fruit, toast and boiled eggs were plentiful and regularly refreshed. More substantial offerings available at additional charge. As a very frequent high end corporate traveller   I found the whole experience to be first rate. At booking you can pre-order beer and wine for room at very reasonable price (6 pack premium beer at $25), other mini bar stocking via reception is small inconvenience. This is my second stay and we will be back....next time without the rental car as unnecessary, despite distance from city because of excellent public transport options.

The headboard discoloured and grimy! Paint peeling off floorboards peeling! Breakfast included was a communal area with one large table and alongside owners two dogs and 7 others it was very congested and not what we were paying for!!. Very disappointed that the manager couldn't see there way to refund even one night but held the two nights prepaid for!! False advertising and photos different to actual space!

First, you either have to climb a bunch of stairs to get into the hotel, OR use the very steep, cement walkway (which has a couple stairs at the top that can't be seen from the bottom). You enter a dark, creepy hallway,</value><value> that enters into a messy, dated, cheap looking "reception/breakfast area." The stairs to the guest rooms are very tight, and if you have a big bag, good luck getting up there. The rooms were reminiscent of an old Motel 6, or something similar, but the beds seemed clean enough, though. The one plus is that the hotel is DIRECTLY across the street from the beach, so if that's what interests you, this location is great for that. Staff seemed nice enough, but didn't love the huge dog who wanders the hotel. (Dog seemed nice, I'm just not a dog fan.) Also, you can smell the doggy smell as soon as you enter the building. Very, very average accommodations, and the website pictures aren't even close to reality. We were very disappointed. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

While i knew it was close, I certainly didn't expect to be right next to the actual rail platform.  If you open the blinds, people</value><value> from the platform can literally peek into the room. The place was constantly vibrating and you could hear the announcements very loudly ever 5-10 minutes. Very poor sleep due to this even though the beds and pillow were comfier than usual hostels.  The other facilities were fine. Showers and toilets were clean, however there are some cubicles with large gaps in the doors so find a good one and stick with it. Kitchen looked good with lots of storage and space, but had very few sharp knives, no oven and extremely poor quality pans (and also not enough).  While I wasn't there specifically for socialising because I had other plans, there seemed to be a lot of long termers there and also a lot of families or older groups so was a strange atmosphere, but they do put on lots of events, free food or cheap meals every day so I'm sure they're definitely worth checking out. WiFi is free but I found videos to buffer when using anything above 360p  Even for the location, I wouldn't stay here again and looking back it was actually pretty expensive.

Our 3 nights accommodation cost about $900 for 3 of us and the location was very handy to shopping, the Harbour Bridge &amp; Barangaroo, eateries</value><value> etc. The pluses - two nice patios with harbour views, it was spacious with two bathrooms, well equipped kitchen with big fridge and beds were comfy &amp; unit had a washing machine &amp; dryer. Complex was very neat and pool, spa &amp; gym clean &amp; tidy. Downsides - the lounge was really uncomfortable, dated and didn’t look clean, carpets were stained &amp; poorly fitting (see photos), in fact there were some industrial style mats to complete flooring in the main bedroom. We met other guests who said their accommodation was more modern so you might get luckier than us. If you’re not expecting a fancy room and just need a base where you can cook a few meals and save money while being centrally located this could suit. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>

It was our first time in Sydney. After doing much research on the web for a place to stay, I happened upon Zara Towers Hotel and thought that I would give it a go. I was not disappointed.    Zara</value><value> Towers is an establishment that has a 5 Star Staff, who are most eager to serve you and make your stay wonderful.  Tim, who has an extensive knowledge of Sydney, gave us great suggestions on places to tour and restaurants to eat at.  The facility is just steps from Central Station, Chinatown, and only about 35 minutes walk to Sydney Harbor, the Sydney Opera House, and the Circular Quay, where you can have a beautiful ferry ride across Sydney Harbor, to Manly Beach.  When first viewing our room upon arrival, I was literally shocked at the amount of space provided, as well as the interior design scheme.  The design is a comfortable "Soho" loft, somewhat modern/industrial design, with one full wall of windows.  There was a full kitchen with a dishwasher, stove, microwave, refrigerator, and range hood, espresso maker, with espresso provided, and a 4 person dining area with distressed leather chairs. Our room also had a dressing area, abundant closet space, a safe, king sized bed, a fold out sofa, a leather sofa in the living room, with flat screen TV, speaker for your iPhone, or Android phone, (you provide the cable), a desk, and bath room with a walk in shower and plenty of vanity space.   A Coles Supermarket is located nearby within the lower level of the World Square Shopping Centre with a Liquor Land store next door, with which to stock your kitchen, and many excellent restaurants and coffee shops (the best coffee in the world) surround Zara Towers!  Needless to say, when we return to Sydney, this will be the place that we will choose for accommodations!</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

I had been enjoying my cooking throughout the trip. The location of the hotel is also flawless, walking distance to many great destinations and shopping place. Lots of restaurants nearby and also a great supermarket within a few minutes walking distance.  The only part I am not happy about is the housekeeping service. As the daily service is not being done properly, the floor are not being vacuumed. The breadcrumbs from the morning was still there when we returned hotel.

The hotel was quiet most of the time (this is not a party hostel!) and girls in my dorm were always very nice and quiet. I also appreciated that the reception was open 24h a day so we can check in late or check out early, and we can store our luggage for free. The staff was also very nice. I recommend this hostel if you are looking for budget accommodation in the city centre (the hostel is 5 minutes from Sydney central station and close to bus stops, perfect to visit the city using public transport).</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name>Big Hostel</hotel_name><hotel_star>2</hotel_star><title><value>Very Nice Hostel Centrally located for the price</value></title><date>201904</date><content><value>I am very please with the Big Hostel. The hostel is in the perfect location. Just a five minutes walk to the Central station. Not far from the Hyde Park.  The staff members ROCK!!!  I met many nice travelers and staff members at the BH . Steve the front desk receptionist is</value><value> really a great guy very helpful!!  The TV room is really nice. It attach to the Kitchen and tables there to enjoy breakfast with other fellows.  Kitchen open up around the clock so you can enjoy getting your mid night snack stored in the food shelf or refrigerator. There is a roof top available to enjoy the fresh air and chit chat with travelers.    I had an 8 bed dormitory which was fine with me. There also a locker available you just need to buy your own lock.  you can buy a small combination number lock at the front desk.  If you want a lock with a key you need to get it at the "Convience store" for $5AU. same price for the combination lock. I prefer the lock with key type so it easier to open and close especially at night when there others sleeping at night so, you do not have to worry using the flash light to look at the number on the combination lock.  When checking in they provide you a clean sheet and pillow case you put on by your self and remove the sheet and pillow case before check out. I had a hard time putting sheet on on the top bunk bed.    As far as for breakfast, Food are totally alternative. What you get is bread for toast, cereal, tea and coffee.  The Kitchen have a lot of ample space for cooking and storing your food.    There is a computer available if you get tired of using your laptop or your phone of courses.   Location is about 98 walk score.  There a 7-11 store, Convience store, Yok Yok Thai restaurant just two blocks very good thai food.  Spicy I am is another Thai restaurant. Vietnamese restaurant I did not dry.  Sash Japanese restaurant just one block is $$$ expensive it basically a shared type of food I had small taco sushi for $9 I had two of them total of $18 plus surchage total of $20.00 the waitress are very friendly, chef is great.    Laudnry is available to do a load is $8.00 total.  cup of soap $1.00  Wash is $4.00 Dry  is $4.00 Totalis $9.00  Very clean Very friendly totally secure Location is great  Next time I stay at the big hostel I want to get a 4 bed dormitory type with a private bathroom disabled access.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

It was very quaint, comfortable - we chose well.  We chose it because it was one of the few rooms with an ensuite bathroom, and was separate from the main building.  What we liked: -  shared kitchen and dining area, where you</value><value> get to meet other guests -  free milk, cereal, bread and fruits.   -  garden - very nice place to relax -  room was very comfortable -  lady at the reception who received us - Brenda. Very, very accommodating and friendly  What could be improved: -  Wifi signal. Almost inexistent in the treetop studio, so we had to go to the main house to get a better signal  By the way, for first-timers in Syndey, Drummoyne is in the outskirts and will require a 10-minute bus-ride to get to the city center.  Fare is around AUD$2.00 and the bus stop is around a 5-minute walk.  There isn't much to do in the neighborhood, and resos are few.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

Rooms are a strange shape, by virtue of the remodelling of the existing building, but they are big, quiet and very comfortable.

The welcome was warm and the service very nice to start. The room (224) albeit small and with stained carpet and somewhat worn down furniture and amenities, had an amazing view over the</value><value> water. Something really delightful to wake up to and you could even see the sunset from there. The windows are drafty and it was a cold night in Sydney, so we had to turn up the heat to it’s maximum 26 degrees to get it comfortable in the room. The auto-closing doors are much too strong, so at 6:30 in the morning when people start leaving the doors slam so loud that the walls shake. The room next to ours was vacated early and the staff started cleaning it making lots of noise and banging on the walls with what I can only assume was the vacuum cleaner. The hallways on our floor were covered in carpet pieces that were taped together every few meters. Definitely not something I have ever seen in a five star rated hotel. We went to breakfast on a Sunday morning and it was utter chaos. There were no tables for four available, so we quietly waited at the bar. My husband and I were then shown to a table for two and we had to explain that we were waiting for a table for for four again. Once sorted out and seated with two coworkers who were staying in their own rooms paying for their own breakfasts, we were brought the wrong coffees 3 times in a row. I could see the staff wasn’t able to keep up with the crowd. The buffet stations were not refreshed and the atmosphere was chaotic. Later during the day when ordering drinks at the bar the male staff was too busy flirting it up with drunk girls at the bar to pay me and my husband any mind. One of the girls even showed me photos of how one of the bartenders had taken her on a motorcycle ride across the bridge during his break. So inappropriate for so many reasons. They also didn’t know how to make a Gimlet, an easy standard gin cocktail. We never check our bills for an upscale hotel, because we assume the staff is honest and barring any accidental mistakes all should be in order. I asked my husband to check the charge for the Sunday breakfast upon our departure and sure enough it was an insane charge of $156. How they arrived at this number I have no idea. The other days we were there they charged $30 per person for the breakfast buffet, so even if they charged us for four breakfasts, it doesn’t add up. I went to the front desk and asked the lady to have a look at the charge and to adjust it to breakfast for two. She told me she would have to check with the staff to see if we were indeed only two people. Mind that our colleagues at our table had their own rooms and their own bills for that breakfast. I was now starting to feel like I was being treated like someone who was trying to rip off the hotel for a breakfast charge. Utterly shameful in my opinion when you’ve paid so much for the room, food and drinks during the rest of your stay. She eventually came around and said she would adjust the charge “for now”, again insinuating I might be telling her a lie.  I would have gone ahead and called in a manager, but I wanted to enjoy my last day in Sydney and really didn’t want to get into any of this nonsense. When we got home we received an email with a copy of the breakfast card for the room that the staff fills out and on it was written 4. Indicating that 4 people had eaten breakfast on the charge of our room. Now this I know had been scribbled in after the fact, because when we were checked in for breakfast that space was blank. Now it has come to the point that we have to reach out to our coworkers to ask them for proof of payment for their breakfast on that day. I am utterly disgusted at being treated like a cheapskate in a five star hotel. On our next visit to Sydney we will be sure to stay somewhere else and probably not a Marriott property either.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

Best tip was to avoid the expensive Bridge Climb and going up the Bridge pylon with museum for $15 per person.  We even got a senior discount ($5 off the price).  Breakfast food provided was much more than expected.  The studio itself, is extremely clean and well equipped.  We did not get to explore much of Annandale and would have enjoyed the local walk Keith recommended.  Next time.

<item><hotel_name>Holiday Inn Old Sydney</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Great location</value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>We stayed here for 10 nights in total. We are a family of 4 and initially had 2 rooms booked for the first five nights of our stay as a family room was not available until our fifth night. We had also booked the room for the night before our arrival so that we were guaranteed</value><value> check in on our early morning arrival but from reading other reviews it seems that staff were able to accommodate early check ins anyway. Sadly we were not given a room with a view of the harbour bridge or opera house, instead we had a city view and although it was pleasant enough it doesn’t come anywhere close to the harbour view which we got to experience from the roof top pool. The rooms are unfortunately tired looking and the bathrooms could do with an upgrade but if you’re just after a place to stay and not looking luxury they are decent enough. However, the location of hotel is excellent. It is next to the rocks and a few minutes walk from the harbour bridge and circular quay so definitely worth staying here for the location. When we moved rooms we noticed that the Family room was no bigger than the standard room and just had an extra twin bed in it so space was a bit limited. The staff are really friendly and helpful and the breakfast is very good with a good selection. Our children also enjoyed having dinner in the hotel and wanted to eat there every night! They also thought Nick from the restaurant was great! The kids corner in the lobby is a nice touch too. We also loved the gelatissimo place down the road. The manager was so friendly there.  Overall we enjoyed our stay here but unfortunately a slight dampener was put on it as when we moved rooms, my 8 year old left her notebook in one of the drawers in which she had some drawings and songs she had written, we notified the reception staff as soon as we realised the next day as she was quite upset to have lost it, and although the staff did what they could to help, unfortunately by then it was gone, and the reception staff were unable to locate it despite looking for it themselves and speaking to housekeeping who didn’t remember seeing it, which is a shame as it must have been picked up by someone. Despite this I would recommend this hotel for it’s location, breakfast and roof top pool.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

We called reception once again and they gave the bathroom finally a thorough clean yet there was no follow-up apology or addressing to the issue.

Room 1301 is next to the service room/ lift, so there are loud bumps and thumps any time of day and night. Very poor!!  This room overlooks the pool and the back of other buildings.. one was being</value><value> renovated, so we got to see the flooring guy work each night till late. Nothing special about this room or service - no extras provided to acknowledge our custom.   Coffee provided was powdered sachets only and UHT milk pods. Lots of places of 3 stars do better than this! Towels had a kind of smell about them like they had been dried near food servicing.. uggh. Toilet seat had lost one of its bumpers leaving an exposed molding... uggh.  Main bar area on level 8 is looking tired - veneer on table tops is lifting, and the textiles on chairs and cushions look worn. A table lamp near my seat had a power cord running to under my chair which had old no longer functional gaffer tape on it. Should have taken s pic to interest health and safety inspectors .. bizzare!  Our main discomfort ( other than paying closer to $1000 for our 4 nights of very medium facility) was that the A/C is such that it is VERY dry! This was even commented on by a fellow guest in the lift one morning. Really uncomfortable!!  Chose this place after staying here previously for 1 night ( &amp; was allocated a much better room) because we needed 4 nights which was proving difficult in the better star rated accommodation which we were treating ourselves to as part of the celebration. Absolutely would not return - value for money just isn’t represented here. Mid level accommodation has lifted its game so much that this was an embarrassing waste of money.  </value><value>…</value></content><stars>10</stars></item>

The minibar, bathroom and everything else was well appointed and functional. Decoration was tasteful and trendy, too.  Location is great. I walked all around the city - Circular Quay, Darling Harbour, Chinatown, Surrey Hills,</value><value> Botanical Gardens, etc. It's also located next to Elizabeth St where you can catch lots of public buses, including one to Bondi, and St James train station for Airport connection. It took me only 30 minutes from check out to arrival at the airport. Overall service was great, except for one night when I called to ask if the refrigerator could be turned off as it was making an unusual noise. The service officer just kept saying there was nothing they could do till the next morning, even though I said it was keeping me awake. I asked for someone to come up to check on it, and luckily, the nice gentleman who came said it could easily be turned off till the next morning.  Apart from that, the room was really quiet at night, which is great for light sleepers like me. I was really happy staying here, and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Sydney. </value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

Stayed in an executive floor room - very modern and well appointed although a bit small for an executive</value><value> room. Bed and pillow comfort rate very high as does bathroom. Views are a bit limited, I expect the permanent apartments which share the building got the better views. Executive lounge was everything one would expect and the comfort and range of food on offer here was excellent. Staff were pleasant although not overly friendly and this stands in marked distinction to say the nearby Hilton or Westin. The only downside was that the hotel lobby is 8 floors above street level so one needs to elevator journeys to come and go. The elevators from ground to 8 are shared with the permanent apartment dwellers and there could often be an annoying wait for an elevator here.

Nope, nothing.  The room was so quiet, we both slept extremely well.  The curtains were very thick and we slept right in on Sunday morning. This was also</value><value> helped by the wonderfully comfortable king sized bed and fantastic pillows.  The bed did take up almost all of the width of the room, requiring a short moment of contortionism to allow me to get to the opposite side past the TV unit jutting out a little from the wall, but it was easy and not really an issue.    We absolutely loved the GIANT shower rose in the bathroom.  So luxurious! The staff were friendly and informative and our stay was very nice.  We enjoyed an aperitif in the downstairs sitting room (very comfortable, includes charging cubes for electronic devices, low tables and scatter cushions on comfy chairs) prior to walking to a restaurant (Firedoor-wonderful) nearby for our dinner.  On walking back we were able to sit quietly and enjoy a nice glass of wine from the bar before retiring to our room.    The lift is small but we didn't find any problem with accessing it.  I would have like to have the option of the stairs, as we were only on the first floor, but couldn't find any stairwell.    On checkout we were asked if we needed to store our luggage for the day - a great service for visitors from out of town.  We were off for breakfast at the cafe next door, then on to the train station to make our way home, so didn't need it, but it's good to know they really go the extra mile to help travelers.    The cafe next door was very busy and had extremely good coffee and food.  Overall I highly recommend Veriu.  The comfy quiet bed, the cleanliness, the location (a short walk from the city, many music venues such as the Wild Rover and the Soda Factory, the restaurants of Surry Hills and much public transport, being so close to Central Railway Station) the sitting area and of course the friendly staff all made our stay very pleasant.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name>InterContinental Sydney</hotel_name><hotel_star>5</hotel_star><title><value>Great location, but poor front desk service</value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>The pros:  great location walking distance from the train station.  Also, walking distance from the Opera House.  The view from the executive lounge and harbor facing rooms is phenomenal.  The service in the executive lounge is great.  The cons:  we had a poor front desk</value><value> experience.  We had booked a room with executive lounge privileges for our 25th wedding anniversary, but we were initially given at the front desk a non- executive lounge room with two twin beds!!  My wife spent over half an hour talking to 3 different employees(after a long trip) about what we booked, but they didn't want to budge.  They finally seemed to begrudgingly concede that we did in fact book the executive lounge with our room, only because my wife was able to produce on her computer saved e-mails from 8 months prior.  It was a rough start to our wedding anniversary celebration, and even after we were eventually given a proper room(due to a lot of work by my wife), we felt unwelcome.  Whenever we left the hotel, we avoided going by the front desk area.  Further, even though we told them it was our silver wedding anniversary, they did nothing special for us, even though they gave us such a rough time at the start of our stay.  The hotel has potential, but we cannot give it a good grade based on our experience.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

GUEST ROOMS: Rooms are tired and in desperate need of renovation.  I can always look past dated decor and furnishings, however, this was well and truly above and beyond that. - Wallpaper in</value><value> our room was peeling off - Lights would flicker and make buzzing noise  - Taps leaked - Toilet had the old fashioned flush button that only worked sporadically - Room was stuffy and dusty - We had a room with 2 double beds.  Be aware that these beds are not a standard size double, they were somewhere between a single and double.  Two adults could definitely not share comfortably.  I ended up sharing with my 8 year old daughter (and we are both slim people) and felt like I was sharing a single.   - Mattress not great, sagged in sections – this was evident on both beds in our room - Room was not serviced until 4pm on our second day, not great to come back from a day out and have to vacate as service staff had just arrived - Pillows terrible (not uncommon) however, no other pillows were available during our stay even though hotel had an extensive pillow menu - Other minor things that normally wouldn’t bother me, but would be nice to know beforehand: Small old TV in awkward position, shower was over the bath  FACILITIES: - Female change rooms near pool/gym were small, dated, dirty and in poor condition, the showers leaked, dirty towels thrown everywhere, floor was soaking wet everywhere - didn't look like anyone had been in there to mop it in a while. - Indoor pool was fine, kids enjoyed it.  Only issue is not enough seating. - Buffet breakfast was good, selection adequate and food cooked well.  I did enjoy the fresh eggs to your liking as well as omelette.  You can order pancakes/waffles at the table, these are not in the buffet.  LOCATION: Great location, less than 5 minute stroll to Circular Quay.  Around 10 minute walk to Pitt Street Mall.  Taxis easy to get.  SERVICE: Service and staff were good, especially check-in staff and valet/porters.   The only exception is our room not serviced until 4pm on Sunday - this was not acceptable.   OVERALL: I was disappointed with our stay and would give InterContinental a miss next time. I have stayed at the following in Sydney CBD and would rank them all higher than the InterContinental: - QT - Four Seasons - Westin - Sofitel - Radisson Blu - Ovolo at Wolloomoolo wharf</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name>The Ultimo</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Good but not great</value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>I have stayed at The Ultimo a couple of times now - it's well priced and a great location but a few things let them down. The basic rooms are really nice with the exposed brick, but this time I was 'upgraded' to the Courtyard rooms, which in comparison are incredibly sterile and</value><value> bland. You also have to drag your suitcase up a large flight of stairs. They look out onto a rooftop, but I had a lot of trouble getting the courtyard door open, and in the middle of winter a rooftop terrace is not entirely enticing. It is also pretty bleak - just some fake lawn and the back of a bunch of airconditioners. Really not worth the 'upgrade'. Also, I was charged for the bottled water in the room - I searched the entire room looking to see if there was a charge for the water, but failed to find anything so I assumed that they were complimentary. I travel a lot for work, and it is very standard to advise on the price of any consumables in the room (if there is a cost). If it's for sale, there really needs to be a price to let people know! All in all, probably won't stay here again or advise my colleagues to stay here (as I did on this trip to my regret!).</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name>The Ultimo</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Almost perfect! </value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>On the bright side....   Well located, lovely decor, great bathroom. Our little family had a nicely appointed family room (big bed and two singles in one room). We were a little disappointed to be “upgraded” from a trio room as we were hoping for our five year old to have an</value><value> alcove away from us (she’s a light sleeper and we like to have lights on/go to bed later than her!). As it turned out, we were all so exhausted from sightseeing that we would have slept through an earthquake and the family room worked out OK.   Beds comfy. Linen nice. Laundry facilities good and inexpensive. Toiletries provided were nice. We got free tea/coffee/hot chocolate during our stay - I think we booked direct and that was one of the rewards..... you may find an offer for free brekkie!   The stay was good value. Short walk to Darling Harbour - don’t miss the Chinese Garden, it’s lovely.  On the downside.....   A large group of teachers and young students were booked into rooms around us and the teachers shouting up and down the corridor woke us up rather early. Note, the students were wonderful. Twice the teachers knocked on our door to wake us up to get ready to go!!!! This was not the hotel’s fault but perhaps we should have been given an option to move rooms to allow them to be together?   The location is rather bustling - which means you shouldn’t expect silence at night. Possibly not the best hotel if you are a light sleeper.   Front desk staff could do with looking up and smiling when you go in and out - it’s the small things that sometimes make the experience!!   WiFi VERY frustrating - kept logging us off and had to rejoin whenever we wanted to use the internet.   We would stay again - but ask for the quietest room available!  </value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

And my second experience here was overall really nice.  Hostel is in a great location of The Rocks and the view from the roof of the harbour</value><value> is lovely at day or night. It's about a 10 minute walk from Circular Quay, which is a stop off the airport line.  I was in a 4-bed dorm which was great size and enough space for four people comfortably (and with luggage). Having the bathroom attached was also a nice treat.  Kitchen at the hostel is big and enough space, but I was here in fall/winter when it was quieter so could be busier in summer or holiday time. Kitchen is well equipped too, although none of the pans were heat resistant on the handles so you had to use multiple towels to handle hot cooking equipment.  Laundry is on-site and powder is available for sale too. Breakfast and coffee is available too for purchase although I did not end up buying.  Closest full grocery store is about 25 minutes walk away, smaller metro market is about 10-15.   Hostel hosts a lot of activities too and was very welcoming for people to join, other than that, it's not a very social place, people mostly kept to themselves.  My only real complaint from my stay was Wifi. It kicks you off regularly and was very inconsistent in working in the main common areas.

Having your own kitchen</value><value> whilst travelling is so refreshing ....great for either a full meal or whipping up a snack whilst watching a movie. My apartment had a balcony which was Lively for catching the afternoon sun in Winter.  The service is friendly and efficient and there is a rooftop pool and gym.  The location is excellent -short walk to the harbour and the historic Rocks area and also a pleasant walk to Darling Harbour. Nearby there is a supermarket and lots of eateries.

Its my very 1st time in Sydney and the experience was superb. You can imagine having a bag full of guilt chips and snack sent to you daily and free mini bar where you can have 2 beers in your room after a long day of walk  sight</value><value> seeing. It was mind-blowing to be told everything was almost free as you don't get this kind of service in other countries in general.   The staffs were excellent in helping me figure out how i should plan my trip and constantly asking me  if they could help in anything which made me feel i was in a house stay rather than a "Hotel Stay".  Would like to commend 2 staff which are Dorthy and Vickki (not sure if i got the names right) They went the extra mile to ensure my wife and I were well taken care of. Appreciate and thankful for their professional / superb customer service. Ovolo Group, you have excellent staffs.  Location wise is really fantastic. It was close to Sydney fish market where i had my sashimi daily and it was close to the harbor where you practically can take a ferry to any part of Sydney.  In summary, Ovolo is by far the best hotel i have stay for my own trip and will be sure to check this hotel group out when i go anywhere in the world next time.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name>Hotel 59</hotel_name><hotel_star>3</hotel_star><title><value>A good value choice</value></title><date>201907</date><content><value>A small and basic hotel, with, for example, limited reception hours. But the owner, George, is very upfront about this, starting with an informative email sent shortly after a booking is made. My room was small, but functional and clean, and included fridge, television and WiFi.</value><value> The decoration was a bit tired (although, in fairness, during my stay, work was being done to repair damage following a leaking roof earlier in the year). Breakfast was included and served in the adjacent cafe. This consisted of a drink and choice of cooked options (prepared to order by George's father) and provided a good start to the day. The owner was present each day and was a good source of practical information and advice. The location is great - in a quiet street, very close to King's Cross station and bus routes, and within easy walking distance of the Botanical Gardens. So, overall, a place with limitations, but recommended for those looking for a good value option in a reasonably central location.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

We settled on Hotel 59 in the King’s Cross region. After much research, it offered us the best (and very reasonable) price per night. It is a family owned hotel. We</value><value> did not have to share a bathroom with another room and breakfast was included in the family owned café downstairs.   We were two couples so we needed 2 rooms (it is a 9-room hotel). One room had a queen size bed and a twin bed while the other room had a queen size bed and two twin beds. The beds were very comfortable and there was a wall air-conditioning unit in each room. It is also only a 4 minute walk to an excellent Hop-On Hop-Off Big Bus Tour stop (which we also signed up for).  Note that the rooms are on the first and second floors and there are no elevators if you are on the second floor. In both of our rooms, the fans did not work well at all, and in one room, the air conditioner worked well but was very noisy. Other than that, for the reasonable money we paid, we had clean, comfortable rooms with kitchenettes and newly renovated bathrooms. You should check out their website for more details and amenities.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

We were able to leave our baggage there until we could check</value><value> in at 12:30. The room was fine with a nice big bed and fridge. Once George told us how to set the air con unit properly we had a great stay.  Breakfast was included and delicious.   Kings Cross station was just a few minutes’ walk as well as a Coles Supermarket, but they stop selling alcohol at 20:00 hrs. There’s a laundrette just next door.   George has lots of good information (get an Opal card for public transport) and, on his recommendation we visited the Koala Hospital at our next stop, Port Macquarie.

The Park Hyatt Sydney hotel is located about 2-3 blocks from Circular Quay station and is about a 20min drive from/to the SYD airport (30min by train). Prior to our</value><value> arrival in Sydney, I had reached out to the hotel to see if we could get some recommendations on things to do and places to eat around the area, as well as request a room with a view (since I heard the views of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge were unbeatable). The hotel couldn’t guarantee a room with a view, but was very responsive to all my inquiries.   We grabbed an Uber from the airport to the hotel (it was approx. $35USD).    Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very courteous and welcoming receptionist and were advised that we did get upgraded to a room with a view of the Opera House and the Harbour (yay!).   We made our way to the room which was on the second floor (the hotel only has four floors) and walked into a spacious King room, first encountering the a huge bathroom with a an open shower (there were doors to the living area which you can close). There was a separate room with the toilet (a Toto bidet - Japanese washlet).  After passing the bathroom area, we walked passed our King bed, a little couch in the corner (and desk) and out onto the balcony. We were greeted with an amazing view of the iconic Opera House, it was incredible! During our stay we experienced a couple of sunrises and sunsets and they were breathtaking! The views are truly magical!   The area where the hotel is located is called The Rocks and it is full of history that goes back to the first settlers who arrived by boats in Sydney. The Park Hyatt Sydney is located right under the Harbour Bridge and is walking distance to many attractions around the city (as mentioned earlier, it is right by Circular Quay where you can catch one of the ferries to Manly, Taronga Zoo, Luna Park, Darling Harbor, and many more).   The terrace/pool area was under construction while we were there, but that did not affect our stay at all.  Everyone at the hotel was very accommodating (special thanks to the concierge staff for all of the restaurant and bar recommendations!).   The Park Hyatt Sydney truly lives up to its 5-star luxurious hotel status. We had an amazing time at this hotel and are so happy we picked it for our first-time trip to Sydney. Everything was perfect and we hope to be back again in the near future! :)  -Patrycja  savitraveljournal.com</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

Unknown to me at the time 12 is actually the first residential floor in the hotel and the tiny balcony no bonus. Why? Because sitting out on the single</value><value> chair on what is ostensibly a lobby roof courtyard was impossible due the smell of fat frying which, incidentally, permeated the 12th floor between my room and the lifts for the entire two nights. It seemed to me it was wafting in from the fans above the hotel kitchens fixed at 12 floor level. On arrival at my door on evening one found an empty wine bottle in a wine cooler directly outside and, bizarrely, after moving it down the corridor found it outside my door again the next evening!! On top of all that, my room on day 2 wasn’t serviced until 3pm when I had scheduled work in the room during the afternoon, this despite my being woken by cleaning equipment banging against my door repeatedly when the shift began early that morning. All in all a downer for mid to late $500s and as a loyalty member. Pluses? Yes, there were some. Great location, comfy bed and pillows, bathroom spotless. Would I stay again? Maybe. But I’ve learned my lesson: 12 is actually 1 and I’ll be looking for something around 19 or 20 which is really 7 or 8. Tip: if you book high floor, make sure it is, and see which way the wind is blowing if you are down on 12.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>30</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name>Cambridge Hotel Sydney</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Great location, welcoming staff, personal service, big room</value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>From arrival the service was very friendly. The room I picked (City View) has a great, western-facing balcony room, bringing in all the afternoon sun across skyline - and overlooking Surry Hills police station, which is worth noting for its value in quietening the streets</value><value> surrounding. Although it has standard setup of bed, sofa, TV, desk, bathroom, it is expanded, far more spacey than a normal hotel room, nothing is squeezed in (I did feel the room ceiling lights could have been brighter, with a common bed switch, but this is a quibble and nothing else). I adjusted the room to my liking, adding a blanket, moving the tea-coffee-making tray, and liked that room-cleaning just made my room up this way every day, rather that "resetting" everything like normally happens in a big hotel chain. The room safe could be bigger, and better located along with the fridge (both away in a corner cupboard, good from that perspective but a bit tight). The bath is not huge but it's a bath! with strong-running, hot water, like its overhead shower, so I was pretty rapt at the end of the day to rest my walking-tired body in it - hotels need to emphasis bath-availability more, IMHO. Location-wise, I often stay closer to the city, but that gets expensive. The Cambridge is only just out, a couple of hundred metres up from the corner of Hyde Park, a short way down Riley (50m?), with access to all Surry Hills has, plus a supermarket close to opposite (Aldi, though there's an IGA on Oxford Street, halfway back towards Hyde Park). Anyway, it's a place I've returned to because it does all I need it, which puts into perspective the quibbles I have. I think it's worth paying extra for the City View room, for the space and the satisfying view (it's not classic Sydney skyline but it is very nice, again, with views to sunset, and a sneaky, between-buildings glimpse in the distance down to the top of the Opera House sails). And, I'd emphasise, friendly, professional staff. Plus a bonus chocolate on checkout, which never hurts.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

<item><hotel_name>Veriu Broadway</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Excellent apartment hotel in the business district</value></title><date>201907</date><content><value>Veriu Broadway is a recently renovated historic building that offers spacious, comfortable and fully equipped rooms for a reasonable price. There is a kitchen with fridge, dishwasher  and cooking facilities and everything in terms of plates, glasses and cutlery that you need.</value><value> The room had a large and comfortable bed for 2, a large bathroom with shower and there were separate washing facilities  (washing machine, dryer, iron and board) as well as a large modern tv and even stereo equipment. The air conditioning unit is new and very quiet. There is a round table that seats 4 and separate easy chairs and sofa in the tv area. The lifts are comfortable and large and the reception doubles as a cosy bar where you can have coffee, drinks and some snacks. Everything is very well organised and very modern, with a lot of  light and space. The hotel is in a very quiet street but close to everything in the city centre, and less than 5 minutes away from a major bus stop that can take you to the beaches and other destinations in the suburbs. The central station is 10 minutes away on foot. Cleaning  is done every day and towel service daily as well. they even top up the supply of washing powder and dishwasher powder.  All in all an excellent choice and very good quality for money.  Public transport in Sydney is very extensive, frequent and very efficiently organised. The easiest way is to buy OPAL cards (in every convenience store), sart by putting 10 AUS$ on it and then top up when necessary. Each time you use public transport you tap the card on a card reader. There are peak periods (9-10.30 and 16.00-18.30) but outside those the prices are really low. And yes, Sydney is one of the most wonderful cities in the world.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>

The hotel is convenient to many locations in Wolloomooloo and easy and peaceful walking distance to city center.  My family and I cooked every night in the apartment - so it</value><value> was great to be close to grocery shopping and have a variety of pots and pans available. Quiet streets and not a lot of noise (except for the kookaburras screeching) so, we slept well - a king-sized bed for the adults and a smaller, cozy bed for our ten year-old.   The free breakfast downstairs was minimal but awesome to have. We took advantage every morning. Being able to do laundry in the apartment was a bonus!  The only reason why I cannot give a 5-star rating, is that the apartment itself had a terrible odor --- something like dirty socks  - that no matter what we did (burn candles/incense, open windows) would just not go away.   Still, the staff went over and above - we were able to store out luggage and they were very helpful in directions. The pub next door is super friendly and they have trivia night every week - !

The check-in was seamless and informative. The very big thing was the way he</value><value> interacted with my grand children. The way he presented them with their arrival gifts, particularly after we had all just had a long flight, and an overpriced very long taxi trip from the airport. But that is another story. They kids were happy and excited with the way he presented them to them. . There was then an almost theatrical act as we were given drink vouchers. Thank you very much to this GSA. The room was well presented, the beds were comfortable. The reason we chose this hotel was it's proximity to Central station, Chinatown and Darling harbour. All are just a short walk away, especially when travelling with 8-11 year olds. The reason we travelled was to attend the Hugh Jackman Concert and do some shopping in the "Big Smoke" This hotel was ideally situated for our purpose. All the staff were very well trained and bent over backwards to satisfy our needs. Complaints. (Very minor) 1: perhaps Housekeeping could check behind the curtains and get rid of the spiderwebs and spiders. 2: The shower sounds like a diesel truck using  compression braking when used. 3:Perhaps you have rooms that have a separate shower and bath that are not combined. Some of us prefer a shower that we do not have to climb in and out of Maybe we should have specified this when booking 4: The biggie. The rooms are set up to accommodate 4 people. They need more than 2 coffee cups! As a former Night Auditor of a Novotel resort  (8 years) and currently a Night Manager of a resort , one of your rivals (Not in Sydney) I know what I expect in the way of Guest Relations.

The views of the opera house and Sydney Harbor</value><value> Bridge were a plus!! We would stay here again many more times! Totally worth the money! There is also a taxi stop right outside the hotel, so when you need to head back to the airport it is easy!

<item><hotel_name>Shangri-La Hotel Sydney</hotel_name><hotel_star>5</hotel_star><title><value>"#58 of 198 Hotels in Sydney" is Probably About Right ...</value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>Stayed in early August as a family of 4 adults and 2 children. The stay was a disappointment, given the reputation of the group as well as the high ratings (4.5 on TA) of the hotel.  First the positives. The location was good, and the views were excellent -- especially from the</value><value> club lounge. The rooms were off good size, giving us ample space to fully open up all (4) of our suitcases. The staff we dealt with was generally (though not always, see below) friendly and helpful, and requests (opening the doors between 2 adjacent rooms) and problems (heater that refuses to heat) were dealt with immediately. These, however, were simply what should be expected of a top-tier 5-star hotel.  Now to the negatives. The shower was the worst I have ever had _IN_ANY_HOTEL_, with weak water pressure -- it wouldn't be an overstatement to say that water just drips from the showerhead -- and (5-second) delayed response from the separate hot/cold faucets, which means water temperature was always wrong. On the first morning, staff at the Café Mix tried to refuse us entry for complimentary breakfast because "you have already been to Horizon Club", when in fact my wife had only gone for coffee; even though the manager immediately rectified the problem and signed of on our entry, we had never encountered such a situation in any other hotel before (Don't comp us if you are going to be cheap about it grrr ...) Finally, despite the views, I was extremely unimpressed following my afternoon visit to the club lounge, as tables were not cleaned (after they were cleared of dishes, so clearly an extremely half-assed effort), with crumbs and leftover food on the tables, chairs and even the floor. The staff at the lounge -- with the exception of the manager -- was seemingly also just interested in "doing their jobs", which basically means any type of request from guests are a nuisance to them. Case in point, the response to my 4pm "good afternoon, check-out please" was a frown (honestly, I think the lady was like "argh, why do you people hate me!!!")  As a Golden Circle Jade member, I did not get any room upgrade, did get chocolates (but did not get any choices) as welcome amenity, did get complimentary breakfast, and did get a 4pm late check-out. Points from the stay posted several days after our stay, which was also slower than the other major hotel groups.  This was my first and will be my last stay at this hotel.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>20</stars></item>
<item><hotel_name>Shangri-La Hotel Sydney</hotel_name><hotel_star>5</hotel_star><title><value>A tale of contrast</value></title><date>201906</date><content><value>We were pleasantly greeted as we arrived on a late Saturday afternoon by the staff in the driveway, the porter assisted with our bags and we made our way in to the warmth of the lobby. There we were met with a line up of 7 other parties waiting to check in, their were only two</value><value> staff members behind the desk and we waited over 20 minutes to be checked in.  Heading upstairs, we made our way to the room which was of decent quality, well maintained, clean and large - we had booked a Deluxe Sydney Harbour King room.  After a long drive from Brisbane my partner and I felt like a quiet night in however the room service menu didn't offer many options for vegetarian or nu allergy guests so we ordered Uber Eats.  We ventured out for the day to meet family arriving from USA and then returned later in the day. That afternoon we were stuck on our floor waiting as there seemed to be an issue with the elevator system not stopping on the way down, you literally had to catch the elevator to the top floor and come all the way down. We let the staff at the front know, yet they didn't seem too interested which for a top level hotel seemed surprising. Every little 1% counts when people are spending that kind of money on a room, food &amp; bev.  The bar on the top level offers amazing views, although be prepared to spend some money (but the cocktails are devine)   All in all, the room was excellent - however some of the smaller things were amiss. Nothing ground breaking, but having travelled quite a lot, I can see how a lot of those little things could add up for someone and ruin the experience.  On a final note, outside of the gent we spoke to about the elevators who was nonchalant the rest of the staff were excellent and delivered great service.  PS. I know I already wrote 'on a final note' but then realise I forgot to mention the complimentary shoe shining service - give it a go, it is excellent ;)</value><value>…</value></content><stars>40</stars></item>

I got a kitchen with washing liquid... a bathroom with various toiletries... but a laundry with no laundry powder / liquid ?!  The door to my room was ajar when I returned one afternoon... I report it and reception simply said "oh - sorry about that, we will tell house-cleaning to close the door" And... ???  The room is grotty - light fittings in the bathroom have seen better days. The upstairs light barely glows in the bedroom.  The hook behind the bathroom door is broken.  The bath mat (towelling) had a tear in it - don't really care... but does not look good.  Toilet bowl is has rust stains - don't really care... but does not look good.  I still don't know what the black marks are on ceiling near the vents - don't really care... but does not look good I hung my clothes on the coat hangers in the closet, only to have the entire hanging bar come unstuck and fall off.  The TV channels were below par... Free to air cricket (The Ashes) nowhere to be found.  Instead of finding a cleaner room when I returned in the evening - I actually found rubbish (not mine) on the floor as I walked in.  Balcony looks tired.  Couch looks dirty. Overall very poor.

But the room we were given was on the lower level and faced the front of the the hotel. You could hear everything extremely loud!</value><value> People talking and bringing in luggage seemed to echo through the room. People shutting hallway doors sounded like a construction zone. Trucks would go by and you could feel the vibrations. We could even hear our neighbors sneezing, talking and having loud sex. With all this on going noise we could not sleep. We asked to move rooms but they said they were fully booked. We couldn't move hotels because we prebooked and it was not refundable. So we suffered through the first night. Staff was kind and said they could move us the second night, which they did. The second room was on the back of the building on an upper level. It seemed a lot quieter. But you could still hear every time someone closed a door or sneezed. Or even if housekeeping came down the hall. Seems like the building need mores sound proofing or at least down the hallways.   Two days later we saw a bill on our room! We called right away. We had been charged for car parking while staying there. We didn't even travel there by car. No one asked us they just charged our credit card. Now we have to dispute it and try to get it refunded.

<item><hotel_name>Mercure Sydney</hotel_name><hotel_star>4</hotel_star><title><value>Perfect Location, Nice Rooms, Breakfast OK.</value></title><date>201908</date><content><value>I stayed 4 nights at the Mercure Syndey and absolutely loved the location of this hotel. Literally 2-5 minutes (depending on walking speed) from central station, which easily got us to Featherdale Wildlife Park. Central station is also a stop on the hop on hop off bus, so you</value><value> can actually have a stop right there. In addition to being so close to transportation, across the street, you have a Sushi Hub (my go-to lunch option while I was in Australia that I wish would come over to the U.S.) as well as a Chemist's Warehouse, a McDonald's, a KFC, a 7-Eleven, and ez-marts (what we in NY call bodegas).   The hotel itself is beautiful and the staff is very nice and friendly. There is a store in the hotel lobby where you can pick up drinks, snacks, and I even saw some souvenirs but I wouldn't buy them at the hotel personally. It's just very convenient having the option to grab a drink before heading up for someone like us who got to the hotel very late the first night (around 11:30PM) and didn't want to go looking for somewhere to pick something up or got back to the hotel after a long day of sightseeing and forgot to purchase drinks before getting to the hotel.  Rooms were clean and, although on the smaller side when I compare it to our hotel in Melbourne, it was actually bigger than I had expected based on pictures I viewed on Expedia prior to arriving. The lack of space only got a little annoying because limited floor space meant luggages were covering what walking space there was in the room, but it's not a big deal and can easily be overlooked considering the excellent location and the rates compared to other hotels.   Oh, just in case it helps anyone, in our room, we had one outlet. And between the beds, there were two USB charging ports.  The only thing I would recommend to the hotel to improve on is breakfast. The breakfast buffet was very limited in options for picky eaters. And while it was nice to see that they changed the buffet options daily, for someone like my son who is extremely picky, it was very difficult finding him something he liked. On our first morning, he was content with the pancakes, but the next day they didn't offer it. I do appreciate that the staff was accommodating and made an order for him, but I would improve the selection in general. I was also surprised there was no option to order an omelette, which is usually standard in most hotel buffet breakfasts. Again, not the end of the world, but something that could improve the breakfast for guests.  I added that there is parking for a fee at this hotel, but I would double-check on the official site to make sure. I just remember noticing a sign by the reception desk that mentioned parking fees for visitors and guests of the hotel (it might be a different amount depending on if you're staying at the hotel or just visiting).  Overall, I can highly recommend a stay at the Mercure Sydney hotel.</value><value>…</value></content><stars>50</stars></item>
